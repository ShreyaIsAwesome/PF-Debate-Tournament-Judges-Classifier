Manoj,"I am a parent judge, judging for over 3 years. I evaluate argumentative logic first and care
about evidence quality and evidence ethics. Speaking presentation and style are for
speaker points but do not substantively impact who wins or loses the debate. Please don't
spend less time arguing about technicalities, more time debating. Please do not
paraphrase when you first introduce evidence. Also, please don't speed-read."
Kika,
Pingdong,"I am a parent/lay judge, Although I have been judging for a few years, I am still not as
familiar with all the debate jargons.
I would like you to make it extremely clear to me, what is most important in this round. I
may not be able to flow every single thing you say, but if you continue to repeat the most
important things, I will note it down."
Rory,"anr2@bxscience.edu
Debated for 3 years in LD at Bronx Science. I don't debate in college.
Generally prefer listening to lay arguments (haven't debated in a while) but I'm fine with
spreading if you send the doc (which you probably should anyways). Or circuit arguments
as long as you're not dumping offs.
Give a roadmap before your speech, signpost, weigh, slow down on the tags you want to
emphasize, a.k.a. make your route to the ballot as clear as possible. Just make it easy for
me to vote for you!
Don't be rude to your opponent. I will not vote on arguments about their character
(callouts and whatnot), especially for things outside of the debate."
Swapna,"hello! i am a lay parent judge!
please speak slowly and clearly so I can easily note down everything you say.
i'm not an experienced judge and i only know the bare minimums of public forum debate.
i'll do my best to be really fair, good luck for your rounds!"
Kirti,"I am somewhat experienced in speech and debate. I prefer use of technical language over
jargons.
I will be open to hear both sides of the arguments and open to new ideas.
I will be taking notes on key argument during the process. Please speak slowly and clearly."
Brendan,
Denzel,"Hey,
My E-Mail is dbell212518@gmail.com (for docs),
Read by AI policy at the bottom
PF: I'm a hyper tech judge I do policy debate in college i'll vote on any absurdity I will catch
anything at any speed it's fine for the most part but ofc you have to be clear
(Policy)
tech>truth (unless it's absurdly stupid)
I'm not bias, I haven't been in the activity long enough to develop preferences for
everything, just be explanative and argue it well and I can vote on it.
THEORY
My only opinion that differs is on theory: ''condo bad, pics bad, 50 state fiat bad'' ect... is
almost never a reason to reject a team but almost always a good reason to reject an
argument.
Generics
Try your hardest not to drop arguments, dropped arguments are considered true and I will
vote on that.
Try your hardest to articulate why I should vote for your stance,
Don't just say ""we are winning on xyz"" then move on. Spend some time on the 'why' even if
it is just 20 seconds.
In the last speeches spell out why you are winning and why the other side is losing.
Basically, project what my ballot should be through proper explanation of your warrants.
Don't assume I know what you're talking about when you explain something (as should
with any other judge), in cases where I do know what you're talking about from experience
out of round it's unlikely that I'll vote on an unexplained argument.
Have fun, don't be overly bearing in crossx it's annoying and corny, if you have a point that
you think you're winning in cross x you don't have to be rude to make me realize that.
If you debate more off of the flow (doesn't mean you have to be actively looking at it, I can
tell if you're debating off of the flow) huge speak boost.
AI: (Highschool) (policy/pf)
AI use is very noticeable to me, I graduated high school last year I know when you're using
it every single time, if the other team is doing clear thought out line by line and speeches
of their own, I will HEAVILY lean on their side on every single flow even negating tech to
some extent because as a judge I believe this is one of the only things my ballot and
evaluate can actually prevent/solve.
Chat gpt in Highschool rounds is for the most part, very cringe, you won't learn anything if
you don't have to mentally process what you're interacting with. I'll probably only nuke
your speaks if I realize that your ENTIRE speech is chat gpt. Its use is inevitable, therefor
using it in round to explain confusing arguments/extend 1 off cards on the fly can be fine
most of the times, but if your prep is just you copying your opponent's entire speech into
the prompt and typing ''pls respond,'' then don't do debate... it's not that serious. But I find
that in most rounds both teams are using it so it's hard to reflect that in speaks/ballot. If I
can tell all of the args are yours, you will get big speak boost like at least a flat 28.5
Ken Bhardwaj Hire 4 rounds 
Add me to the email chain: kenbhardwaj2@gmail.com
Please let me know if I can do anything to accommodate you in your round.
About Me:
Two years of experience at Coral Academy in Public Forum (dabbled in DUO, LD, EXT, XDB,
and WSD); competed nationally for one year went to the TOC and won the Nevada State
Championship. Now I’m a pre-med sophomore at the University of Nevada, where I’m
studying Neuroscience and Journalism.
PARADIGM
Novices: Be good on the flow and don't be offensive. I give out good speaks for impactful
endings, jokes, personality, and efficiency. There are other ways to get good speaks, but
without one of those, a 30 is hard to attain.
TLDR: Reasonably Tech > Truth. I like weighing. 50/50 chance I adapt on a lay panel. Write
my RFD for me in the last speech.I'll disclose my decision (if tournament rules allow for it)
and give some level of feedback.
Pref Sheet:
1 — Tech Substance
2 — Phil, Theory
3 — Stock/Topical K's
4 — T, Identity K's
5 — Tricks
Prep Time:
Track your own time, I trust you won't lie to me. Flex prep is fine.
Evidence:
Make the evidence exchange quick. I may take a peek at your cards, but I won't do
anything about it unless the other team calls it out. If you get caught paraphrasing in an
extreme manner, I'll dock speaks accordingly. Engaging with evidence is important.
Speeches:
You can speak at a faster speed. Do send me docs, but I won't use it as an aid during your
speech. You get two clears before I stop flowing. Recently I've found that timing speeches
tends to slow my flow, so please raise your phone for overtime responses.
Cross:
Nothing said in cross goes on my flow unless it's brought forward into subsequent
speeches. Be assertive, but not overly aggressive. A good cross will benefit your speaks,
even if you lose the round overall. If everyone is in agreement we can skip grand for a
minute of extra prep. Open cross is fine if that's your preference, just make sure to ask the
other team first.
2nd Rebuttal:
2NC disads are fine. Roadmap, signpost, and frontline. If no frontlining, you'll lose and I'll
be sad. Generated offense here has to be in the form of turns, no new disads, no new
framing.
Summary:
No new evidence. (Unless it's to frontline in first summary)
Defense isn't sticky. Extend defense in every speech; you can't forget to extend a piece of it
in summary and do a ritual in final focus to summon it. I should be able to draw a line
from the 2AC to the 2AR.
Extensions don't have to be perfect. As long as you extend uniqueness, links, and impact,
you're good. Line-by-line frontlines count as extensions. Collapsing is good here
Weighing is important. I like seeing comparisons between evidence, impact scenarios, and
links. This means that the weighing has to be comparative. Weighing is not ""we cause a
nuclear war"" and nothing else. I want to hear ""We outweigh on timeframe because our
impact triggers instantly while theirs takes x years"" – that's direct. If teams present
different weighing mechanisms, please meta-weigh. If neither side meta-weighs, I default
to timeframe + magnitude.
Final Focus:
Everything in FF should've been in summary.
I just want a solid explanation as to why you won the round. You can do it line by line, or
go by biggest voting issues. Just make sure you're extending what was said in summary.
Framing:
I like a good framing debate. I won't accept ""Other team has to respond in their
constructive"" or ""Other teams can't read link-ins to the framing"" as underviews or general
responses.
Theory:
Disclosure is good, paraphrasing is bad. if there's no offense from either side I err to those
positions, but won't hack for them. If you're varsity anything is fair game, ""theory is dumb""
and ""we don't know how to respond"" are non-responses.
I won't vote theory down simply because it isn’t formatted the 'correct' way. If there is an
allegation of abuse and that abuse is substantiated, I will treat it the same way I would a
shell. Be sure to explain why they should lose the round, not just the argument.
Content Warnings:
They're okay, but I think there is a very real risk of it being co-opted by structural
oppressors to suppress marginalized voices, as history has shown with the censorship of
civil rights, queer, and feminist discourse. While I acknowledge the real impact of trauma, I
fear that empowering gatekeepers to restrict speech does more harm than good,
reinforcing systemic oppression rather than dismantling it. That being said, I'm not
debating you on whether the argument has validity or not, I will listen to and engage with
the argument, I just think you should be wary of running it in front of me.
K's:
Just send a doc so I can follow along. Cross is important in these rounds. I won't vote on
something I don't understand because you tell me I'm supposed to. Don't run Afro-pess if
you're not Black, don't run Fem-Rage if you're not female-identifying.
Speaks:
I generally give high speaks (28 - 29.5 range), but it's not impossible to get a 30 from me.
Have a good strategy (like going for turns, innovative weighing), have a personality, and
you'll be guaranteed high speaks. A Taylor Swift reference gets a +0.1, stackable to 0.5.
If you have further questions about why I voted a certain way, you can email me and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can. If you have any questions not covered by this paradigm, feel
free to hit up the email at the top or ask me before the round starts.
Good luck, have fun, and do your best!"
Jamie,"Send speech docs: brashearjamie@gmail.com
I am a fairly experienced lay judge who can follow spreading.
If you believe the other side has dropped a contention, I encourage you to point that out.
If there is a problem with the other side’s evidence, call it to my attention. I will examine
the evidence in those cases."
Venkat,I am a parent judge.
Jing,"I am a lay parent judge.
I judge the debate based on clear and consistent speeches and which side provides more
substantial supporting evidences."
Kate,"I have been judging debate for approximately a year and a half and have evaluated rounds
at many tournaments, beginning in Fall 2024, including the GMU Patriot Games. I am a
parent judge with experience across multiple formats.
I value respectful engagement above all - toward opponents, partners, and the activity
itself. Clear, logical argumentation is essential. I am persuaded by well-structured cases
supported by statistics, evidence, and explicit weighing. If you want to win my ballot, tell
me why your impacts matter more and by how much. Numbers, comparative analysis, and
clear prioritization go a long way.
I appreciate dynamic, engaging speaking, but I am equally receptive to slower, very well-
articulated delivery, provided clarity and organization are maintained. Speed is fine if it
remains intelligible; clarity always outweighs pace.
I view cross-examination as a critical strategic moment. Use it to expose weaknesses,
clarify assumptions, and set up later arguments. Effective cross-ex should advance your
narrative or undermine your opponent’s case, not just fill time."
Dean,"Email chain: dean.carman@verizon.net
Background: Parent judge. No HS/college debate experience. CPA by training. I’ve judged
175+ rounds in ~3 years and I flow carefully (not perfectly).
How I vote: I vote off the flow. If it’s not in Final Focus, it’s not in my decision. I compare the
Final Focuses, resolve the contested clashes, apply established defense, and decide on the
best-explained/weighed world. I won’t reconstruct missing links or revive dropped
arguments.
Delivery: Conversational pace. Don’t spread or speed-read. Clear roadmaps/signposting
and consistent tags. If I can’t flow it, I can’t evaluate it. Crossfire isn’t flowed; if it matters,
say it in your next speech. After any jargon, give the “so what” in plain English.
Rules/structure: Not topical = not on my ballot. No new arguments after Rebuttal. New
evidence in Summary only to answer new material; no new links/warrants. Dropped then
revived = new argument = too late. If you claim a turn, label it and explain the “so what.”
Impacts/weighing: Do the link chain and comparative weighing
(probability/magnitude/timeframe/scope). Don’t just name impacts.
Politics: No ideology filters. Win the warrants, win my ballot. Ballot isn’t a patriotism, or
“did I sound left-leaning enough” test.
Final Focus: Give me a clear story + weighing, not a frantic checklist. If I can paste it into
Tabroom with minimal editing, we’re both having a great day."
Joel,"Background
I’m a first-time judge and still learning debate. I’m here to listen carefully, keep the round
fair, and decide based only on what happens in the debate. Clear explanation helps a lot.
How I decide
I vote for the side that best explains:
what their main arguments are
why they matter
why they outweigh the other side
Please tell me directly how to evaluate the round and why you win.
Speed & clarity
Conversational or slightly faster is great.
I’m not comfortable with very fast spreading. If I can’t understand it, I can’t evaluate it.
Signposting and organization are appreciated.
Arguments
I’m open to most arguments as long as they’re explained clearly and in plain language.
Quality of explanation matters more than the number of arguments.
Impact comparison is very helpful.
Evidence
Explain your evidence and how it supports your claims. I evaluate based on what’s said in
the round.
Conduct & points
Be respectful and professional.
Speaker points reflect clarity, organization, and persuasiveness.
Bottom line
Help me follow the round, tell me what the key issues are, and explain why you win.
Thanks, and good luck!"
Ting,"Lay Judge. I am super unfamiliar with the topic. please go extremely slow otherwise I will
not be able to understand your arguments. I value presence, confidence, and also
argument quality."
Young,"This is my 3rd year judging debates for BASIS Peoria.
You get my ballot if you present clear structure of speeches and contentions/arguments
and most importantly, strong delivery. Give off-time roadmaps! I am open-minded to all
arguments (no extinction impacts) but, there has to be clear links. If the links are not clear
to me, I will not vote you, even if you have simple arguments to understand.
NO SPREADING**
For speaks:
30 - if you are the best speaker I've seen judging so far.
27 to 29 - you fall in the average to good category.
26 below - you need work.
Please time yourselves and raise your hand if your opponents are over time. Grace period
is just finishing your sentence and anytime after that I'm docking speaks.
Be respectful - everyone is doing this activity because they love to do it."
Kwok,I am a fairly new judge with one time judge experience.
Beth,"My background: I am a former CEDA debater (1987-89) and CEDA coach (1990-93) from
East Tennessee State University. Upon my retirement in August 2021 I've judged
numerous at numerous debate tournaments for PF, LD, IDPA, Parli, and Big Questions
(mostly PF and LD). (FYI, when I participated in CEDA it was quasi-policy, not true policy like
it is today.)
Speed: I can keep up with a quick-ish speed - enunciation is very important! Pre round I
can do a ""speed test"" and let you know what I think of a participant's speech speed if
anyone wants to. I think it is especially important to make sure cases are comprehensible. I
look at speech docs if something only if evidence is questioned. I was never a super speed
debater and didn’t encourage my students to speed. Please keep all this in mind if you
normally utilize speedy delivery.
Theory: I am familiar with topicality and if other theory is introduced, I could probably
understand it. (I also used to run hasty generalization but not sure if that’s still a thing or
not.) Theory is best used when it’s pertinent to a round, not added for filler and needs to
be well developed if I am expected to vote on it. That being said, I also give the team
defending themselves against a theory shell quite a bit of latitude to do so; I look more at
the big picture of theory vs. arguing a dropped point or 2 and trying to pull it through to
win. Please do not run poorly developed/poorly substantiated disclosure theory especially
if you're not meeting the disclosure standards you're arguing your opponent does not
meet.
The rounds: Racism/sexism etc. will not be tolerated. Rudeness isn’t appreciated either. I
do not interject my own thoughts/opinions/judgements to make a decision, I only look at
what is provided in the round itself. Re: criteria, I want to hear what the debaters bring
forward and not have to come up with my own criteria to judge the round. My default
criteria is cost/benefit analysis. I reserve the right to call in evidence. (Once I won a round
that came down to a call for evidence, so, it can be important!) As far as overall judging, I
always liked what my coach used to say – “write the ballot for me”. Debaters need to point
out impacts and make solid, logical arguments. I appreciate good weighing and I will weigh
the arguments that carried through to the end of the round more heavily than arguments
that are not. Let me know what is important to vote on in your round and why. Sign
posting/numbering arguments is appreciated and is VERY important to me; let me know
where you plan to go at the top of your speech and also refer back to your roadmap as
you go along.
Cross Examination: a good CX that advances the round is always valued. If someone asks a
question, please don’t interrupt the debater answering the question. I don’t like to see a
cross ex dominated by one side.
In most rounds I will keep back up speaking time and prep time.
I hope to see enjoyable and educational rounds. You will learn so many valuable skills
being a debater! Good luck to all participants!"

Bhargava,"Lay judge, and first time judging, my son is writing this for me. Speak slowly, clearly, and
articulate your arguments well. NO PROG (K's, theory, trix, phil, etc) or ""layified prog.""
Avoid FWK debate unless you can explain it REALLY well, but even so, I'd probably not go
for it. Try not to speak >150 wpm and always err on the side of overexplaining. Impact
weigh starting summary, and do it clearly on impact calc like magnitute, probability,
timeframe, etc. No blippy warrants---implicate everything well. NO NEW ARGUMENTS IN
FINAL FOCUS!!! Signpost EXCESSIVELY - be really clear when saying ""on our case"" ""down
their case.""

Michelle,"I am a PF lay judge. My daughter competes in PF debate. [Beware ;-)].
I judge based on the rules, not on my personal views or opinion, (which is probably lucky
for you). If you say it, I will believe it unless your opponent strikes it down. Crossfire
discussions will not be considered in my final decision, so be sure to say what you want to
say during the constructive portions of the debate.
I do not respond well to spreading. The quality of your key points is more important than
the quantity of words you use. The faster you speak, the harder it is for judges (including
me) to keep track of all your points and ensure we can accurately track the flow. You have
worked hard building your case so make sure we judges can hear all the important points
(i.e., talking like a squirrel who has consumed 200 pots of coffee will not enable judges to
hear and comprehend your arguments).
Finally, I worked for many, many years in corporate America. Advice that served me well -
and which will serve you well too is - Tell me what you're going to tell me, tell me, and then
tell me what you told me. In other words, make the arc of your case crystal clear (extend
your case)."
Hosna,"Hello!
I am a first year at the University of San Francisco studying environmental science and
public health. I'm so excited to start judging after all these years of competing!!
Debate Paradigm
My background in debate is quite long! I have done debate for 6 years, winning 2 ND state
championships and runner-up in Public Forum Debate, and going to nationals twice for PF.
I have also gone to nationals in congressional debate-senate as well. If you're reading this,
I have been exactly in your shoes of reading the judge paradigm 5 minutes before the
round starts, so I will (try to) keep it short and pretty.
Simplicity: I know you only have 4 minutes to shove a whole plan in my face, but keeping
your case straight to the point will grab your judge's attention. I do not want to do
research in the middle of the round trying to understand what you are stating for your
arguments. Please always clarify what you are saying. It might make sense to you, but will
it make sense to someone who has never heard of the resolution? Also, I do not need a
definition on simple words such as ""ought"" or ""in"" or ""be"" (real-life examples btw), let's be
so for real right now. Your judges don't know a lot about the topic, but they aren't that
unaware! Give yourself more time to say your case.
Logic: I am sure you have seen the ""if you can fix climate change or wars in one 60-minute
round, I'll personally fly you to the UN"" comments a lot, but I am kinda ok with stuff like
that. I think a lot of those problems can be fixed in such simple ways, but we have dumb
people running our world. Don't be afraid to expand your horizon in your case, just
nothing too crazy like saying the earth is flat or something. I am also a fan of comparison
or giving hypotheticals to help me understand your case better. Additionally, do NOT give
me a pre-written rebuttal or summary speech, I can totally tell when someone is giving me
gibberish they gave 3 rounds ago. Don't shout a bunch of sources and numbers in my face
either.
Etiquette: Maybe this is me being messy and a former debate kid, but I like some heat in
cross fire. Obviously, use proper manners and don't be a b-word, but if you haven't gotten
your question in, get it! It makes you look bad if you are just answering questions and not
asking...no debate or argument can be generated on your side if you have no answers
from the other team.Additionally, please keep chatter to a minimum when your opponent
is speaking.
Also, I check cards if they sound fishy. Misrepresenting a card is an automatic loss.
Rebuttal:Give me reasons why I should vote for you, AND give me reasons why the other
team's case isn't as strong as yours. I always do comparisons on cases. You could have the
perfect case, but the other team can give me reasons why they have the better case, and
they would get my vote. I want big impacts at the end of summary or FF. I don’t usually
flow the voters given by the competitors, i usually just pick what was discussed the most in
the round. (Roadmaps will always help me with that!). Always defend your constructive
points throughout the debate, even if your opponent did not touch it. Mentioning the
opponent did not touch your arguments discussed throughout the whole round weighs
heavily on my ballot decision.
I want to feel like I made the world better because I chose you. Also, you don't have to do
this, but if you could add some one-liners to end your rebuttal speech with some oomph,
that would be cool too ;)
I love fun and silly debates that can also be serious and not get too off-track. Have fun,
enjoy your final years of debate before it's too late :')
Speech
I have only done speech for 2ish years, and loved it! I went to nationals my senior year in
OO and won state speech in OO as well
I'm not really sure how I write a paradigm for speech... If anything, I would say to please be
a good audience member. I have seen kids not pay attention or even start talking in a
middle of a student's performance, and that does not make you cool! I am not saying I
would deduct a student for such behavior, but it'll be pretty hard for me to find grace for
your performance the same way you gave the previous student's performance.
If you stutter, not the end of the world. In fact, It won't affect your ranking. Same with
forgetting a line. Take a breath, and retrack.
Time signals: Regardless of any event, I will give time signals, you just have to ask :).
Asking for them will never make you look less of a performer!
Extemp kids:I will say I have always found humor fun in these events. This event is already
serious as it is, add some fun to it! Additionally, I would say you need at least 5 sources to
make your speech credible. Idc how you credit them, as long as I hear some credit.
Interpers: I only have ONE thing to say, which is to take a small beat before you go into
your introduction! I can never tell when someone starts their introduction or not when
they do not do this, and I don't wanna auto 9 you!"
Xiong,"Hi, I’m a lay judge. My background is not in debate, so I will be evaluating rounds based on
clear, logical arguments rather than technical jargon or debate theory. If you want me to
consider something, make sure to explain it in a way that an average person would
understand.
Please speak clearly and at a moderate pace, as English is not my first language. I value
strong argumentation, good use of evidence, and clear impacts. I also appreciate good
organization and signposting so I can follow your points easily.
I will do my best to be fair and objective in my decision. Respectful and persuasive
debating will go a long way in making your case convincing. Looking forward to judging
your round—good luck!"
Carol,"in 2023. I am now a sophomore at Swarthmore College and coach for American Heritage
Palm Beach.
PLEASE READ — TL;DR
BASICS
*Tech>Truth to the best of my ability.
*Please make a speech drop or send an email chain to alexander.huang@ahschool.com
(no Google Docs), and label it properly: Yale Round 1: Durham HH (Neg) vs Taipei CW (Aff).
Send docs before front-half speeches and send them quickly.
*I will vote by first looking at weighing and then links into the weighing, but feel free to
make arguments for why I should vote otherwise.
*Every part of an argument must be extended for me to vote on it, and anything I vote on
must have a warrant.
*Second rebuttal must respond to first, and there should be nothing new past summary.
*Speaks will reflect your strategy and execution, of course, but also the non-content
aspects of the round: you'll get high speaks if you show up on time, send evidence quickly,
stay organized, speak clearly, and are respectful—you'll get low speaks if you're late, if you
take forever to send docs, if you're a jerk, or if you steal prep time.
*Pet peeves: if you try to call everything by policy terms. If you call the rebuttal the 2AC or
your contentions ""Advantage 1"" and ""Advantage 2,"" I'm going to physically cringe. It's not
aura, I promise.
HOW TO WIN
The biggest thing you can do to increase the chances you win the round and get good
speaks: provide good warranting and analysis using your brain and not the doc.
*Warranting: the state of warranting in PF is atrocious. Anything that doesn’t have a
warrant is a meaningless claim to me and I won’t evaluate it. That means
1) If you say try or die or we link-in or we short-circuit without reading a warrant for
why and explaining the implication, I’m not evaluating it as weighing. Saying jargon is
not weighing. If you say “try or die,” I’m ignoring you. If you say “it’s try or die –
they’ve conceded that climate change is inevitable by 2050 so extinction is non-
unique in their world. The only risk of solvency is the aff. Any risk of offense on
climate means you vote for us” that is actual weighing.
2) If you read one line about how 2026 is key for timeframe with no warrant for why
2026 is key I’m not evaluating it as weighing
3) I’m not letting you go for impacts or hidden links that are one line parts of
evidence and not tagged as such, and I won’t let you sandbag warrants in later
speeches
4) “No warrant,” if won, is terminal defense to whatever you’re responding to
*Analysis: Get your face out of the cards. If you look up at me and do real analysis I will be
so pleased. Some policies I’ve borrowed from Mac Hays:
1) Chances of getting 30 speaks are inversely proportional to the percent of your
speech that is read off of a computer.
2) Speaks are capped at 29 if you read more than 50% of summary and/or final
focus off of a computer. For TOC Digital, obviously it will be harder to tell, but trust
me, I’ll know.
SPECIFICS
*Do not sacrifice analysis for speed and/or shenanigans. While “tech” in place of “truth”
means that I try to limit the influence of my own personal beliefs to the maximum extent,
it does not mean that the need for your analysis to be coherent and persuasive is absent:
a) everything must be sufficiently warranted even if its conceded, b) I'll side with good and
persuasive analytics against cards. Smart analysis is always going to triumph over bad,
unwarranted evidence. Tech debate that is in-depth and full of smart analysis is so much
fun. Tech debate that is fast blips that are unwarranted misconstructions of bad evidence
is boring and noneducational.
*Speed is fine, but be clear. Slow down on tags and in the back half. Use speed
strategically. 3 slow minutes of the best argument in the round is always going to beat 18
mediocre arguments read at lightning pace.
*Cross is binding, but must be brought up in speech
*Implicate good defense against weighing. There is a trend in PF where both teams try
to find the quickest link into extinction, and all defense goes out the window. I am not a
fan. If you are winning terminal or near terminal defense against an extinction outweighs +
short circuit, tell me why I shouldn’t look there first. A 0.00000000000000000001% chance
of something occurring rounds to 0, after all.
*Theory: If you are initiating theory against novices/a team that clearly does not know how
to respond, I won't evaluate under competing interps, and your speaks will be tanked. It
must be read in the speech after the violation. For your information (because I think there
is inherently a little more intervention in theory debate, since we are debating about
debate, and the persuasiveness of certain responses is going to be based on what I have
seen in debate), I generally think paraphrasing is bad, and disclosure is good, but I would
be willing to vote any way on theory. I would be receptive to round reports theory about
teams that put ""OS"" instead of writing what they read.
*Ks: I have a relatively high threshold for a quality K in PF. I really believe you can't just
port Ks from LD and Policy into PF. I think a quality K is very educational, and also fun to
watch. However, to be a quality K, a K should be treated like a research project – high
quality work that is clear, done yourself, and disclosed for others to interact with. I have a
very low tolerance for Ks that are stolen from LD or Policy, read against teams who barely
link, and are generally unintelligible. If I feel like you are reading a K not because you want
to debate the K literature but because you are trying to get out of debating anything at all,
my threshold for responses will be very low.
*Phil: I'm completely down to evaluate phil, but your explanations ought to be very good.
A) I'm not familiar with most of the terms in metaethics and normative ethics, and I won't
vote on something I don't understand. B) If you're going for something very complicated,
I'm not going to fill in warrants for you - you still have to extend everything relevant to your
framing.
*Non-starters: no tricks, no speaks theory, no friv theory, and no ad-homs.
*Post-rounding: Post-rounding is educational, but be polite and curious. I’m not going to
change my decision. Ask to learn more about why I wasn’t persuaded, but there is no
debate between you and me."

Hello,
I am a parent judge. So the round should typically be traditional, I do know how to flow
and evaluate arguments.
Things I consider in the round:
Do not speak fast. If I do not understand your argument I will drop it.
Evidence. You must have evidence proving your point
Framework. You must give me good evidence and reasoning on why your framework is
better than your opponents.
Do not run progressive arguments (theory, etc. unless absolutely necessary. As I said above,
The round should be traditional.
Weighing. Weighing is important for me. Please weigh correctly.
Most of all, have fun and be polite."
Kashyu,"
I am a lay, parent judge. Please speak slowly and clearly, and put emphasis on weighing to
demonstrate exactly why your side should win the round. I will try my best to take notes,
but please do not speak fast as I cannot guarantee I will be able to take effective notes. I
cannot judge theory arguments or kritiks. Please be kind and respectful to everyone in the
room: I look for a fair and educational debate. I do not disclose on the spot."

- Please read paraphrasing theory in rounds where the opponents are paraphrasing.
Paraphrasing is an awful practice, evidence is VERY important to me, and I am happy to
use the ballot to punish bad ethics in round.
- Send speech docs before each speech in which cards will be read.
- Speed is fine but you MUST spread correctly. If you go the same speed on tags as you are
going on card text, you are not spreading correctly and I will clear you. IF I CLEAR YOU, IT
MEANS I CANNOT HEAR YOUR TAGS, AND IT SHOULD CAUSE YOU GREAT ALARM.
- 2nd rebuttal must frontline, defense isn't sticky, and if I'm something is going to be
mentioned on my ballot, it must be in both back half speeches.
- Please weigh.
- I will let your opponents take prep for as long as it takes for you to send your doc or
cards without it counting towards their 3 minutes, so send docs pls and send them fast."

Assistant Debate Coach, Blaine High School - 2013 to 2014
My preferred debates are ones in which both teams have come prepared to engage each
other with some reasonable expectation as to what the other team is going to read.
Debaters should have to defend both their scholarship and practices in round. If you've
chosen to not disclose, are unable to explain why the aff doesn't link to the K, or are
otherwise unprepared, you're fully welcome to try to explain why you should not lose in a
varsity level competition. However, strategies that are purposefully meant to run to the
margins and seek incredibly small pieces of offense in order to eke out a win due to the
reliance on shoddy scholarship, conspiracy-peddlers, or outright fabrication will be met
with intervention. If your argument will fall apart the moment I spend maybe thirty
seconds to confirm something for my RFD, you should strike me.
This activity only exists so long as we implement practices that allow it to. All of our time in
debate is limited(though some rounds can feel like an endless purgatory or the tenth layer
of hell) but the implications of how rounds are conducted and behavior that is put forth as
an example will echo far into the future. You should want to win because you put in more
effort and worked harder.
Prior to the round
Please add my personal email christian.vasquez212@gmail.com and
blakedebatedocs@googlegroups.com to the chain.
The start time listed on ballots/schedules is when a round should begin, not that everyone
should arrive there. Even if I am not there for it, you should feel free to complete the flip
and send out an email chain.
The first speaking team should initiate the chain, with the subject line reading some
version of “Tournament Name, Round Number - 1st Speaking Team(Aff or Neg) vs 2nd
Speaking Team(Aff or neg).”
I do not care what you wear(as long as it’s appropriate for school) or if you stand or sit. I
have zero qualms about music being played, poetry being read, or non-typical arguments
being made.
Non-negotiables
I will be personally timing rounds since plenty of varsity level debaters no longer know
how clocks work. There is no grace period, there are no concluding thoughts. When the
timer goes off, your speech or question/answer is over. Beyond that, there are a few things
I will no longer budge on:
1. You must read from cut cards the first time evidence is introduced into a round. The
experiment with paraphrasing in a debate event was an interesting one, but the activity has
shown itself to be unable to self-police what is and what is not academically dishonest
representations of evidence. Comparisons to the work researchers and professors do in
their professional life I think is laughable. Some of the shoddy evidence work I’ve seen be
passed off in this activity would have you fired in those contexts, whereas here it will
probably get you in late elimination rounds.
2. The inability to produce a piece of evidence when asked for it will end the round
immediately. Taking more than thirty seconds to produce the evidence is unacceptable as
that shows me you didn’t read from it to begin with.
3. Arguments that are racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. will end the round immediately in an L
and as few speaker points as Tab allows me to give out.
4. Questions about what was and wasn’t read in round that are not claims of clipping are signs
of a skill issue and won’t hold up rounds. If you want to ask questions outside of cross, run
your own prep. A team saying “cut card here” or whatever to mark the docs they’ve sent you
is your sign to do so. If you feel personally slighted by the idea that you should flow better
and waste less time in the round, please reconsider your approach to preparing for
competitions that require you to do so.
5. Defense is not “sticky.” If you want something to count in the round, it needs to be included
in your team’s prior speech. The idea that a first speaking team can go “Ah, hah! You forgot
about our trap card” in the final focus after not extending it in summary is ridiculous and
makes a joke out of the event.
6. I will not read off of docs during the round. I will clear you twice if I am not able to
comprehend you.
7. Theory is not a weapon or a trick. Hyper-specific interpretations meant to box the opponent
out of a small difference as to how they’ve conducted a practice are not something I’m
willing to entertain. Objections based on argument construction/sequencing are fine
though.
Negotiables
These are not set in stone, and have changed over time. Running contrary to me on these
positions isn’t a big issue and I can be persuaded in the context of the round.
Tech vs truth
To me, the activity has weirdly defined what “technical” debate is in a way that I believe
undermines the value of the activity. Arguments being true if dropped is only as valid as
the original construction of the argument. Am I opposed to big stick impacts? Absolutely
not, I think they’re worth engaging in and worth making policy decisions around. I
personally enjoy heg, terror, and other extinction level scenarios. But, for example, if you
cannot answer questions regarding what is the motivation for conflict, who would
originally engage in the escalation ladder, or how the decision to launch a nuclear weapon
is conducted, your argument was not valid to begin with. Asking me to close my eyes and
just check the box after essentially saying “yadda yadda, nuclear winter” is as ridiculous as
doing the opposite after hearing “MAD checks” with no explanation.
Teams I think are being rewarded far too often for reading too many contentions in the
constructive that are missing internal links. I am more than just sympathetic to the idea
that calling this out amounts to terminal defense at this point. If they haven’t formed a
coherent argument to begin with, teams shouldn’t be able to masquerade like they have
one.
There isn’t a magical number of contentions that is either good or bad to determine
whether this is an issue or not. The benefit of being a faster team is the ability to actually
get more full arguments out in the round, but that isn’t an advantage if you’re essentially
reading two sentences of a card and calling it good.
I am not a fan of extinction/death good debates. I do not think teams are thoroughly
working through the implications as to what conclusions come from starting down that
path and what supremacist notions are lying underneath. If a villain from a B movie made
in the 80s meant to function as COINTELPRO propaganda would make your same
argument, I don’t really want to hear it. Eco-fascism is still fascism, ableist ideas of what it
means to have a meaningful life are still ableist, and white supremacists are still going to
decide in what order/what people are going to the gallows first.
Theory
In PF debate only, I default to a position of reasonability. I think the theory debates in this
activity, as they’ve been happening, are terribly uninteresting and are mostly binary
choices.
Is disclosure good? Yes
Is paraphrasing bad? Yes
Distinctions beyond these I don’t think are particularly valuable. Going for cheapshots on
specifics I think is an okay starting position for me to say this is a waste of time and not
worth voting for. That being said, I feel like a lot of teams do mis-disclose in PF by just
throwing up huge unedited blocks of texts in their open source section. Proper disclosure
includes the tags that are in case and at least the first and last three words of a card that
you’ve read. To say you open source disclose requires highlighting of the words you have
actually read in round.
That being said, answers that amount to whining aren’t great. Teams that have PF theory
read against them frequently respond in ways that mostly sound like they’re
confused/aghast that someone would question their integrity as debaters and at the end
of the day that’s not an argument. Teams should do more to articulate what specific calls
to do x y or z actually do for the activity, rather than worrying about what they’re feeling. If
your coach requires you to do policy “x” then they should give you reasons to defend
policy “x.” If you’re consistently losing to arguments about what norms in the activity
should look like, that’s a talk you should have with your coach/program advisor about
accepting them or creating better answers.
Kritiks
Overall, I’m sympathetic to these arguments made in any event, but I think that the PF
version of them so far has left me underwhelmed. I am much better for things like cap,
security, fem IR, afro-pess and the like than I am for anything coming from a white pomo
tradition/understanding(French high theory). Survival strategies focused on identity issues
that require voting one way or the other depending on a student’s
identification/orientation I think are bad for debate as a competitive activity.
Kritiks should require some sort of link to either the resolution(since PF doesn’t have plans
really), or something the aff has done argumentatively or with their rhetoric. The
nonexistence of a link means a team has decided to rant for their speech time, and not
included a reason why I should care.
Rejection alternatives are fine(Zizek and others were common when I was in debate for
context) but teams reliant on “discourse” and other vague notions should probably strike
me. If I do not know what voting for a team does, I am uncomfortable to do so and will
actively seek out ways to avoid it."
Kendrick,"Background: I debated at Memorial High School in Houston for 3 years, graduating in
2018. I mainly competed in extemp in high school, and I qualified for TFA State in FX and
the TOC in Extemp and Informative. I also qualified for Nationals in World Schools debate
twice and reached the quarterfinals of World Schools in 2018. My main debate events
were Public Forum and Congress, which I did on and off for the most part.I have largely
judged on the TFA circuit in Texas since I graduated high school in 2018, and I consider
myself most proficient at judging World Schools Debate, Congress, and public speaking
events.
My email for any email chains is knfjudges@gmail.com. My philosophy on email chains is
thus: I like to be on them to evaluate any evidence disputes at the end of round, but I will
not be flowing off the email chain or using it to cover any gaps in my flow. Debate is
fundamentally an oral activity—if it were going to solely be two cut documents warring
against each other, there'd be no reason to have everyone compete in the same room and
try to persuade a decisionmaker orally—so I prefer to judge rounds based on what's said
orally in the round. As a corollary to that, I'm not that good with handling spreading—I
generally flow by hand these days, so I can pretty much only process as fast as I can write.
WSD: Remember that WSD is not LD or PF, and I will not be ""voting on the flow"" the way
that LD and PF judges do. I will generally try to stick to the 68-72 range for each speaker,
although I've found myself going under that range more often than I've gone over. Of
course, this means that you might not like my decision at the end of the day. To lessen the
odds of that happening, here are some tips to maximize the chances of winning my ballot:
For content: ""The House"" is understood to be the whole world unless specified otherwise.
Therefore, your content score will not go above 28 unless you bring solid international
examples to the table. Generally, the more empirical and the less hypothetical evidence you
bring to the table, the better you'll tend to do.
For style: I would say the easiest way to improve style points on my ballot is with speeches
that have personality. Obviously, this will differ from speaker to speaker, but I have rewarded
speakers who depart somewhat from the ""clean speech without fluency errors"" kind of
model and bring humor, personal connections to the topic, anecdotes, etc. to the table.
For strategy: Teams that are consistent down the bench, especially teams that have a
consistent team line, will tend to do better in strategy. I also evaluate POIs here; generally,
teams should take 2 POIs, usually at the transition between points that were elaborated on
during the roadmap.
PF Debate: I want to see a clear claim/warrant/impact structure with clear weighing at the
end of the day; I've frequently found myself wanting some brief framing analysis or meta-
weighing throughout the round as well (especially on evidence quality and strength of
link). I am not receptive to theory or kritikal arguments in PF (this includes disclosure
theory, etc.). The more that the final speeches can give me clear voters and/or write my
RFD for me, the better the round will turn out for you. Defense is not sticky (please carry it
through the flow). Finally, please remember that this is public forum debate, not ""shorter
policy,"" so please avoid spreading, and touches of rhetoric are always welcome (and will be
reflected in your speaker points).
LD Debate: I am open to hearing all kinds of arguments (I do not consider myself a
traditional LD judge), but I simply ask that you explain your arguments well. If I cannot
explain your argument in the RFD on the ballot, I will not vote for that argument. For Ks,
make sure that the link is specific to the case and that the alt makes sense. I will warn you
that I have heard many bad Ks in my life, and while I have voted for Ks in the past, that
doesn't mean I automatically like every K that I hear. In addition, it's really no fun for
anyone to hear rounds where the AFF has never heard of the K, and their only response is
""the NEG doesn't have a value and a criterion so we should win."" So try to remain
respectful of your opponents as well.
Repeated from PF but... I really appreciate good meta-weighing (especially on evidence
quality and strength of link), and the more that the final speeches can give me clear voters
and/or write my RFD for me, the better the round will turn out for you.
Congress: I would say that I prefer content over presentation. When evaluating content, I
look to the type of speech being given (constructive, rebuttal, and crystallization) and my
expectations for each type of speech... Unfortunately, I have found that there are many
constructive speeches given later and later in the chamber, and many so-called rebuttal or
crystallization speeches that neither rebut nor crystallize. Please, please, please remember
that this is congressional DEBATE and not congressional soapbox. I love clash and I hate
repetitious arguments.
Relatedly, I really detest when chambers need to take in-house recesses at the beginning
of items because nobody is prepared to debate. I believe that I have somewhat
contributed to this problem by stating that I prefer well elucidated speeches over speeches
that were extemped in the chamber. To be fair, I don't want to hear these speeches for the
sake of giving a speech, but I am now of the belief that I should reward the representatives
who are actually prepared to debate in my rankings. So do with that what you will.
Public Speaking: In extemp, make sure you answer the question in a well structured
manner. Sources are also important to me; I read both foreign and domestic news on a
regular basis, and BSing a speech is not the way to win my ballot. (For the record: I have
checked sources that sounded fishy, and I have tanked speakers who have egregiously
misrepresented sources. Misremembered the date or the publication for a source? Fine,
I've done that before, and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt! Told me that Boko Haram
has attacked Egypt or that a New York Times editorial praised El Salvador's Bitcoin
experiment when, in fact, it panned it? Not OK!)
For all events, I enjoy humor; for the two platform events, I also like to hear a personal
connection to the topic throughout the speech, as well as unique takes on common topics.
Please elucidate the stakes for your speech so we know why it's important that we listen to
you for 10 minutes about a given topic."

1. Please try to go slow so that I am able to clearly understand.

4. Please ensure to keep the track of time.

Kian,"I did PF in high school, and I’m in university now. I am a flow judge and generally
tech>truth. Tournament permitting, I will disclose and give RFD - time permitting, I will be
as thorough as possible. My feedback is meant to help you improve in debate, so make
sure to ask questions if needed; judges are your resources.
How to win the round:
1. WARRANT everything. Don't just read card names. Be thorough in explaining your logic and
layering your cards to build a sound argument.
2. WEIGH starting in rebuttal. Compare your impacts to your opponents’, and tell me why yours
is better through magnitude, probability, time frame, etc. Good weighing = why I should
vote for you.
3. Have a NARRATIVE throughout the round, from start to finish. Treat your case like a story, and
always be clear, cohesive, and concise.
Strategic Advice/Preferences:
1. Collapse and extend. You are really unlikely to win by going for ALL 5 contentions. Try not to
bring up new things in summary, and definitely not in final focus (I won't flow it).
2. Framework that is uncontested or conceded will be used to evaluate the round.
3. Signpost where you are on the flow. It helps you, your opponents, and me. I appreciate line-
by-line debating.
4. Time yourself. I will also time and let you know when you are over. I would rather hear you
finish your point than cut it off abruptly but consistently going overtime is generally
disrespectful as tournaments run on a schedule (I may dock your speaker points).
5. Crossfire is to ask questions, not to read cards, unless both teams agree to it. I don’t
flow/decide on cross so make sure to bring anything important back into your speeches.
6. Read relevant content warnings before case.
7. I prefer sharing case + cards in email chain (or Google doc) as I find it improves the
accessibility of debate, but it is up to the teams to go with/without it.
8. I prefer you don't run theory/k’s.
Finally:
DO NOT be discriminatory, rude, abusive, insensitive, etc - You risk being reported or at
best you will get a 25. There is absolutely no place for this in debate (or anywhere else).
Always conduct yourself in a way you, your team, and your coaches can be proud of.
Let me know if you need anything extra and I will do my best to accommodate you.
Have fun and good luck!

Emma,"I coach Public Forum at Grace Church School in NYC. My role as a HS English/writing
teacher shapes my approach to coaching and judging debate in the sense that I really care
about how your speeches are organized, warranted, and evidenced. I'm not highly
technical, and my concern is that technical language is often used to bypass the process of
explaining your arguments to me. Don't just say ""de-link"" as a shortcut; be specific and
walk me through the logic of why there's no link.
Clash is extremely important and I reward teams who respond to the particular nuances of
their opponent's logic. I can handle a moderate amount of speed if your speech is well-
organized and clearly tagged (at a minimum, slow down for taglines).
You can include me on the email chain (egolden@gcschool.org). I take evidence
comparison seriously and I will look at your sources to evaluate their credibility. However,
debate is ultimately an oral activity, and I try to base my decision solely on what I heard +
what I flowed.
Best of luck in your round!

Update based on Emory 2025
Put the public back in PUBLIC forum. The jargon, the theory, the nonsense arguments…
y’all are killing this event and as someone who has been a part of it since 2006, it makes
me very sad. I understand that you want to win and want to do well - but what happened
to best practices? When did we stop flowing? When did we stop responding to defense
before extending our offense? Why is every extension through ink? Why are we not
analyzing the evidence that our opponents are reading? Why are we reading evidence
from 2015 in 2025 - has nothing changed in the last decade?
Yes, I’m probably a dinosaur. And maybe I’m in the minority in the judge pool. But I think if
you listen to the conversations in the hallways at Emory this weekend, you’ll hear a lot of
“what is happening?!” “Why is this happening?!” “Where did PF go?!” Etc. Ultimately, it’s up
to y’all how you want to debate - but I’m done voting for the nonsense. I’m going to hold
teams to a high standard going forward. Preserve the public in PF. Please.
Updated for Online Debate
I coach in Taipei, Taiwan. Online tournaments are most often on US timezones - but we are
still competing/judging. That means that when I'm judging you, it is the middle of the night
here. I am doing the best I can to adjust my sleep schedule (and that of my students) - but
I'm likely still going to be tired. Clarity is going to be vital. Complicated link stories, etc. are
likely a quick way to lose my ballot. Be clear. Tell a compelling story. Don't overcomplicate
the debate. That's the best way to win my ballot at 3am - and always really. But especially
at 3am.

Paradigm
You can ask me specific questions if you have them...but my paradigm is pretty simple -
answer these three questions in the round - and answer them better than your opponent,
and you're going to win my ballot:
1. Where am I voting?
2. How can I vote for you there?
3. Why am I voting there and not somewhere else?
I'm not going to do work for you. Don't try to go for everything. Make sure you weigh. Both
sides are going to be winning some sort of argument - you're going to need to tell me why
what you're winning is more important and enough to win my ballot.
If you are racist, homophobic, nativist, sexist, transphobic, or pretty much any version of
""ist"" in the round - I will drop you. There's no place for any of that in debate. Debate
should be as safe of a space as possible. Competition inherently prevents debate from
being a 100% safe space, but if you intentionally make debate unsafe for others, I will drop
you. Period.
One suggestion I have for folks is to embrace the use of y'all. All too often, words like
""guys"" are used to refer to large groups of people that are quite diverse. Pay attention to
pronouns (and enter yours on Tabroom!), and be mindful of the language you use, even in
casual references.
I am very very very very unlikely to vote for theory. I don't think PF is the best place for it
and unfortunately, I don't think it has been used in the best ways in PF so far. Also, I am
skeptical of critical arguments. If they link to the resolution, fantastic - but I don't think pre-
fiat is something that belongs in PF. If you plan on running arguments like that, it might be
worth asking me more about my preferences first - or striking me."

Lay Judge, very inexperienced. I will try to do my best to evaluate the round as a traditional

No Theory, No Kritiks, No Framing please. Don’t add me to any email chains either.
I am not good at flowing and I will do my best to take notes, and I will judge. If you are
winning your arguments you should be very clear as to why I should vote for your
arguments rather than your opponents.
Looking forward to some great rounds!"

arguments
i can flow speed fine, but PLEASE slow down on taglines and analytics, and PLEASE be
clear, or i might just give up. i probably have a somewhat higher threshold for warranting
and implications than your typical tech judge; your path to the ballot should be clear
enough by ff that you can give a flay speech
do not read tricks
i've distanced from the activity a little bit, so assume i know nothing about the topic and
that i'm a little rusty
if i'm judging you in policy or ld i'm so sorry
pref shortcuts:

probably most comfortable judging this. genuinely read whatever
K: i initiated a k in almost every single hypertech round i debated for the latter 1.5 years of
my career, but i read mostly topical, stock stuff (cap, sec, etc.). used to love them, but now
i'm quite tired of thinking. should still be good for kvk and like anything under the sun, but
don't assume i know your lit at all

Jess,"I'm the mother of a PF debater, he's writing this paradigm for me (I normally use better
grammar).
I'm a lay judge - treat me as such.
SPEAKING: Speak slowly and clearly (duh, lay judge).
HIGH DEBATE: When you see the words lay judge, you def shouldn't be running theory,
kritiks or tricks, but I'll put this in there jus in case someone decides to be weird.
LAY CASES: Being a lay judge doesn't rlly mean you need to have a rlly stock case. I can
understand more complex arguments and I've been trained in flowing, so I can follow
along pretty well.
CROSSFIRES: I don't flow crossfires if you think somethings important bring it up in your
speech
NEW ARGUMENTS: Ik everyone wants to run new arguments in final focus the moment
they see they have a lay judge - don't be a bad person. Also, again, I understand the rules
of debate pretty well so I'll probably catch you if you do this.
BEHAVIOR: Be nice to each other, don't say anything discriminatory, hateful, harmful and
or profane or I'll vote against you and dock a whole lotta speaker points so obv don't do
that (I feel like this goes without saying but most judges put this in their paradigm so i
guess i will too)
SPEAKER POINTS: Here's the fun part
If you say ronaldos better than messi i will give you 0 speaker points and give you a loss
(joking? my mom wants me to say that im joking idk)
If you even say the word ""seahawks"" dont expect good speaker points (joking?)
references to My Little Pony will get you bonus speaker pts - if you sing one of the songs
even more speaker pts at the cost of your self respect (definitely a joke - but you should
test this)
I respect professionalism (even if my son doesn't) and wish you all the best."
Lucian,"I am a new parent judge, treat me as such. No kritiks, theories, tricks, etc.
I don’t flow crossfire - if you want me to evaluate something from cross, bring it up in a
speech.
Truth > Tech
Don’t bring up new arguments in Final Focus - I will notice, so don’t waste your time.
Speak at a reasonable pace - quality > quantity.
Obviously don’t be rude to your opponents.
Good luck and have fun!"
Idris,"me muster up a significant amount of experience in a wide range of debate formats/styles
such as; the British Parliamentary Format, World Schools Format, World Scholars Format,
Public Forum, Lincoln-Douglas, Asian Parliamentary, and Speech Events.
Judging Pattern:
I always approach any debate I'm about to judge as a globally informed citizen, whilst
making sure I toss any conceivable personal biases I may have about a topic aside. This
means that to convince me in a debate room you must make sure your arguments are
credibly realistic and persuasive within the scope of the debate. A couple of things to bear
in mind about my judging pattern -
• State your contentions/arguments clearly and back them up with enough analysis to
prove your case.
• Make sure you're creating a fair means of engagement towards your opposition. This
means that I do not expect you to just present your contentions in a vacuum and expect
them to win - I also expect that you challenge the contentions of the opposition and create
comparatives to show why your contentions are superior.
• Ensure you highlight your arguments in a well-organized structure - I do not expect that
in the middle of contention A, you then transition to contention B abruptly. Take your time
to fully explain your contentions while also being time-conscious.
• Role fulfilment is also important. So make sure you fulfil your roles perfectly.
• For Speech Events - I appreciate absolute creativity during your presentation. I expect
that you use all that is within your means to execute whichever role you're taking on in
whatever speech event I am judging you in. I take notes of your eye contact, body
language, energy, and expressions while speaking.
Side Notes:
• I have a slight preference for medium-paced speeches. This does not however mean that
if you're naturally a pacy speaker, you're automatically disadvantaged when I'm judging
you. I would give your speech equal attention and assessment on a meritocratic basis
regardless of how fast you speak, but if you can, just take deep breaths as you present
your speech rather than zapping through.
• I admire it when competitors respect, value, and have a deep sense of mutual
understanding for each other during rounds. This means I totally detest irritable attitudes
such as rudeness, hostility, and intolerance. Kindly be on your best behaviour and be very
conscious of how you interact with your co - competitors.
Whenever you come across me in a debate room, I can guarantee you quality judging and
the most accurate feedback (either written or orally) , I also hope that in my little way, I
contribute towards the growth of your speaking journey."

PF General
email: jakobdebate@gmail.com (send all docs incl. rebuttal)
I coach at my alma mater where I competed at (Lincoln East) and currently I compete in
NFA-LD for UNL. I've also co-founded MDP (masterdebaterprepouts.com).
I'd prefer Speechdrop/Tabroom Doc share. If (hopefully not) we have to do email chains,
please clearly label them (Tournament Name, Round #, Team1 vs. Team2).
TL;DR
The single best way to win my ballot is if you go for quality over quantity cards, where your
turns are fully implicated out and any conceded links/warrants/etc. are fleshed out in the
backhalf. Please make the round easy for me to evaluate, as less intervening is a win-win
for all of us. It is detrimental to this activity to limit students to what they can and can't
read; read anything you want, however you want.
Preferences
- Too many teams tend to impact weigh their arguments without winning the link; you
must effectively warrant and be (somewhat) ahead in the link story before you can weigh.
This also means all clashing link-ins and prerequisites should preferably be resolved.
- In the debate round nothing is true: everything is tech.
- I can handle speeds upwards of 250+ wpm, but I'd prefer you to be slower on tags &
analytics, fast on the rest... thus spread with clarity.
Progressive Arguments
* I encourage you to set rules and norms through tricks and theory but don't be morally
repugnant.
* I have zero preference on 'debate norms'; I'll vote for paraphrasing good, disclosure bad,
and anything else you could possibly think of, as long as you win it.
* My defaults are no RVIs, reasonability > ci, spirit > text, DTA, in-round > out of round, and
must respond in next constructive.
* Over-explain the K; any response strategy will do but I'd rather engage in run-of-the-mill
framework + perm + alt deficit."

While I haven’t judged PF before, I do have experience judging Congressional Debate, and I

Here’s what I value in a round:
1. Please speak clearly and at a moderate volume — I should be able to hear every word without
straining.
2. I prefer logical, well-reasoned arguments over emotional appeals.
3. Be polite and respectful toward your opponents at all times.
4. Provide a clear introduction and a well-organized summary at the end.
5. Don’t interrupt your opponents aggressively — civil exchanges are appreciated.

structured and supported by reasoning and evidence."

tldr -- read any and all arguments, debate however you’d like, just be accessible and kind,
the more complicated an argument is, the more explanation and judge instruction i need.
pf --
i am open to anything and everything, especially styles of debate and debate practices that
are often frowned upon because debate is getting too dogmatic. judges who say they’re
“tech > truth” but are unwilling to evaluate certain arguments or will tank your speaks for
making them are just straight up lying.
two exceptions -- a) don’t be discriminatory in any way and b) don’t lie.
there’s no right or wrong way to debate, but i do have varying levels of experience on
different types of arguments that might affect the quality of my decision.
speaks --
i feel like i’m too expressive to not inevitably nod for what i think are winning arguments so
i might as well try to actively do it.
there’s a lot above on how to gain or lose speaks generally. if i were to ever give a 30,
here’s what you’d have to do:
win paraphrasing good or disclosure bad
acquiescence (can’t give you any more than this)
make fun of anuj lohtia or satvik mahendra (has to be good)
respond to an argument in second constructive and they kick it in first rebuttal
beat the kritik without reading any evidence (excluding substance and extrapolations of it)
read gcb (greatest conceivable beings get perfect speaks duh)
the fastest way to lose speaks is being rude or just unnecessarily aggressive. be kind to
your opponents, but feel free to post round me in any way. respect would be ideal but
emotions run high and i get it."
Tanish,"Judging is a critical aspect of ensuring fairness, accuracy, and quality in competitive events
across various disciplines. The following paradigm aims to provide a comprehensive
framework on how I assess the participants fairly and effectively.
1. Clarity of Evaluation Criteria:
Define clear and specific evaluation criteria tailored to the nature of the tournament.
I ensure to understand the criteria thoroughly to maintain consistency and fairness in
evaluations.
2. Fairness and Impartiality:
I emphasize the importance of impartial judgment irrespective of personal biases or
affiliations.
I encourage to focus solely on the performance or presentation without prejudice.
3. Transparency:
I maintain transparency throughout the judging process by explaining the criteria to
participants and providing feedback when possible.
I disclose any potential conflicts of interest and ensure they do not influence judgments.
4. Feedback Mechanism:
I provide a constructive feedback to participants to facilitate their growth and
improvement.
I also offer specific feedback based on the evaluation criteria.
5. Ethical Considerations:
I Emphasize ethical behavior among participants, including confidentiality, honesty, and
integrity.
I Prohibit any form of discrimination or unfair treatment based on personal characteristics.
6. Continuous Improvement:
Solicit feedback to all participants to identify areas for improvement in the judging
process.
Regularly review and update the judging paradigm to adapt to changing needs and
emerging best practices.
Thank You for going through this Paradigm. ALL THE VERY BEST."
Daljit,"
This is my first time judging, I am a parent judge with some knowledge of the topic but
please treat me as a Lay Judge and speak without spreading and with clarity.
Your points in your topic should stand out with empirics and statistics that show numbers
and values rather than evidence that just ""states"" things.
Do NOT misrepresent your evidence to your opponents and always be clear and directed.
Summarize the cases that you believe will make you win the debate at your final speeches.
Using real world examples is very beneficial to your case.
Make sure to emphasize the futuristic implications of you and your opponents case and
compare impacts at the summary and final focus.
Please tell me the speech order and the duration of each speech, (constructive, crossfire,
rebuttal, etc).
I look forward to seeing an engaging and interesting debate"
Preston,"TL;DR
Traditional-leaning tech judge. Clear signposting, warranted extensions, and comparative
weighing are key. Ks and theory are fine, but need to be explained clearly. I don’t flow
cross, and I’ll say “clear” once — after that, I stop flowing new material. Above all, be kind
and have fun.
Background
I competed in all major debate events (PF, LD, Policy, Congress, and Extemp). I broke at
NSDA Nationals in PF, competed in Congress semifinals at NCFL Nationals, and
qualified for the TOC in Congress.
I come from a small, resource-limited team without access to elite coaching, briefs, or
camps. Because of that, my judging style leans traditional, though I’m familiar with the
most common arguments and comfortable evaluating progressive rounds when explained
well.
Paradigm Overview
Tech > Truth: I’ll vote for warranted, extended arguments even if I personally disagree —
unless they’re blatantly false or abusive.
Traditional lean: Progressive arguments are fine, but comprehension is sometimes harder
for me. Please explain clearly and slow down on theory/Kritik vocabulary.
Speed: I’m fine with speed, but if I can’t understand you, I’ll say “clear” once. High
conversational pace is ideal.
Judge instruction: I’m happy to let debaters decide how the round should be evaluated —
just communicate it clearly.
Argument Preferences
Signposting and Roadmaps: Please roadmap and group arguments (e.g., “three turns on
Contention 1”) instead of jumping around.
Extensions: Must include claim + warrant + impact.
Weighing: Explicit comparative weighing (probability, magnitude, timeframe) is essential. If
no weighing is done, I default to probability.
Kritiks/Theory: I’m fine evaluating them, but they often go over my head if not well-
explained. Define key terms, outline links, and give me a clear impact story.
Evidence: Quality matters. Empirical or peer-reviewed sources weigh more heavily than
simple news articles.
Defaults: If not specified, I default to tech over truth, drop the argument, not the debater,
and presume the least interventionist world.
Cross-Examination
I do not flow cross. If something comes up that you want on my flow, repeat it in your next
speech.
Courtesy matters. Rudeness or belittling behavior will lower your speaker points.
Misunderstandings are not excuses to be disrespectful.
Speaker Points
I don’t like speaks as a tiebreaker and don’t want them to keep anyone from advancing
when they’ve won the debate. As a result, I tend to give high speaks by default.
The only exception is poor conduct — disrespect, rudeness, or hostility will lower speaks.
Debate is competitive, but it should also befun and rewarding. Do your best, be clear, and
enjoy the activity.

Surbhi,"Speaking Pace: I prefer a clear speaking style over speed.
Timing: Please respect speech times.
Expectations:
• Clarity and confidence are key. Speak in a way that is easy to follow.
• Present a clear and well-structured argument. I want to understand your position.
• Show a strong understanding of the topic—demonstrate that you know what you’re
talking about.
• Use credible citations and solid evidence to support your claims.
• Persuasion matters! Confidence and effective communication will strengthen your case.
Be well behaved and respectful to your opponent(s) and enjoy the debate rounds, good
luck!"

tldr:
debate should be a place where everyone feels accepted and respected. whether you win
or lose, you should feel proud of yourself! this activity is hard, and just participating in the
first place is a real accomplishment.
experience:
former debater from sf roosevelt in south dakota. qualified to nsda nats & gold toc! now @
georgetown university in washington, d.c.
key things:
-id say im a flow judge, tech over truth, and also i try to be tabula rasa as best as i can.
-collapse pls!
-SIGNPOST I BEG
-also pls extend (you don't need to extend authors bc i don't write them down but you
should def extend warrants, links, impacts etc)
-i listen to cross so don't lie in speech abt what happened in cross
-defense is not sticky
-pre-reqs, short-circuits, and link-ins are gasssss
-EMPIRICS WIN, OFFENSE WINS, WEIGHING WINS
-debater math is terrible don't do it
evidence sharing:
id prefer y'all setting up email chains before round and sending docs before speeches. it
really makes life easier for everyone and prevents stealing prep, delaying the tournament,
etc. (also add me to the email chain.... im540@georgetown.edu )
speed:
please don't spread. i can handle a conventional speed, but id prefer not to miss one of
your arguments and then you end up losing because i thought you didn't say it. if you
think you're going fast but not spreading, then you're probably fine. if i say clear, then
you're going too fast. SLOW DOWN ON TAGS PLS
prog:
theory: i'm most familiar with disclosure theory, but i'm not opposed to trigger warning
theory or paraphrasing (any other types of theories will need to be extremely warranted).
friv theory is annoying, so pls don't run if u want good speaks. also, have good cut cards
pls.
kritiks: i have zero experience with k's so you will really have to dumb it down for me (i'm
not against you running k's).
cps, plans, trix: no.
other:
if you have any questions feel free to email me at im540@georgetown.edu"

four years of high school at BASIS Independent Mclean. Some of my notable achievements
include 2025 NCFL Grand Nationals Public Forum Champion, 2x NCFL Nationals Qualifier,
Northern Virginia Regional Champion, Northern Virginia Regional Runner-Up (2024)
Email for evidence exchange: sachin.letchumanan@gmail.com
TLDR; I am a flow judge with an appreciation for lay debate
General Preferences:
Email Chain: Please add me to the email chain if one is being used.
Tech > Truth: I default to technical debate. (i.e if something is conceded, it is presumed as
true)
Substance vs Non-substance: I am most comfortable evaluating substance and theory.
Please do not run Kritiks, Tricks, or other non-traditional arguments—I likely won’t evaluate
them fairly.
Theory: I will only entertain theories on issues such as disclosure, paraphrasing, or serious
ethical violations (e.g., racism or ableism). Don’t run frivolous shells.
Spreading: I’m okay with spreading, but you must send a doc
Weighing: Weighing is not optional—it’s critical. Lack of comparative weighing makes it
much harder for me to decide a round.
Turns: All turns must be fully extended in every speech after they’re introduced. Think of
them like mini-contentions. Even if conceded, they must be extended to matter. [I am more
than happy to vote for a turn if it is extended and weighed]
Defense: Not sticky. If it’s not extended in the next speech, it’s gone. That includes
summary.
Summary: Extend the full case chain. Tell me clearly what argument(s) to vote on.
Final Focus: No new responses. I won’t flow them.
Crossfire: I value CX—especially from a lay perspective. A portion of my RFD will reflect
what happens there. Be respectful and avoid hostility.
Prep Time: I do running prep. Just say, “We’re starting prep now,” and I’ll start the clock. No
need to ask for a specific amount beforehand.
Other Notes:
Presumption: If offense on both sides is negligible by the end of the round, I will presume
neg, unless given a strong reason not to. Aff has the higher burden because they advocate
change from the status quo.
Disclosure: I will disclose decisions if the tournament permits it.
Conduct: Be respectful. Excessively rude or inappropriate behavior may result in an
automatic loss.
Fun Rule: Ask me a fun question before round so I know you read my paradigm :)
Feel free to reach out with questions at sachin.letchumanan@gmail.com — I’m always
happy to clarify anything!

THIS TOPIC IS TERRIBLE. I'll literally vote on anything like insane/terrible cases.
Please just entertain me I hate this topic. i'm not an aff hack i promise that last topic
was just bad. i am so washed and i hate online debate please just like try to slow
down < 225 wpm and warrant and weigh and I'll be happy. I have not debated in like
two years so I'm not responsible for not getting weird new metas if you don't
warrant them out to me.
TLDR: slow down, warrant, weigh, collapse, extend. thanks
General:
please someone say something funny
Add me to the email chain: fionayli1004@gmail.com
Any turns and offense need to be implicated as to why it outweighs another argument or
why it takes out an original argument. unimplicated pieces of offense forces me to
intervene and usually that's a giant toss up.
Tech >>>>>>> truth
Speed < 230 I beg. Won't drop you for faster but go faster at your own risk because if I don't
understand you it's cooked. I strongly prefer not to flow off speech docs. If I don't hear
something and it's on your speech doc I will probably default to what I hear.
Frontline in Second Rebuttal, extend defense in first summary, defense isn't sticky (unless the
meta has massively changed or smth in that case probably warrant out why you're doing what
you're doing)
Generally entertained by funny arguments/niche arguments/sometimes entertained by
theory
Any offense u want me to vote for has to be extended from all the links from fiat to a
fleshed out impact.
How I vote: weighing first -> whoever’s winning weighting’s offense, if they win their offense
they win-> if they don’t I go to other offense -> if neither team has offense I will presume for
who has better weighing unless I get presumption warrants alrdy -> absent presumption
warrants, weighing, and offense I will flip a coin to presume. Please do not make me flip a
coin. I will be sad.
how I evaluate weighing absent being told how to evaluate between diff types of
weighing: short-circuit/pre-reqs/link-ins > magnitude/scope> timeframe > strength of link >
probability ( am i washed??? are there new types of weighing??? if there r tell me because id
I don't flow cross. Might pay attention if it's a k or theory round.
I don't flow overtime at all. There is no grace period.
new warrants are new arguments and will be treated as such
if you point out an argument has no warrant and it actually has no warrant I treat it as
sufficient defense.
if u rlly want me to pay attention to smth saying some variation of “lock in this part’s
important” would entertain me and probably force me to pay attention
feel free to post round. Feel free to argue with me I make mistakes but obviously after
submitting I can’t change my decision.
If you have questions feel free to email me before the round.
PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE READING THEORY:
Defaults: yes rvis, reasonability, dta, quirky pref but I default if you win no RVIs then a turn or
winning competing interps still means I don't vote for the turns/competing interps as offense
because the warrants for no RVIs also apply to them. Any of these preferences are easily altered
with warrants.
Every single rule for normal substance debate I have applies to theory. I need extensions. i
need warranted responses and warranted arguments and arguments need to have
implications and weighing.
even if you win turns/das remember you need to weigh them against the shell in order to
adequetely win offense on the shell.
collapse on one or two standard in summary/final focus and just frontline/weigh it fully. It
makes the round so much cleaner. I don't require shell extension in rebuttal so please do not
waste time doing.."

Ethan,"Some background:
I did PF throughout high school and parliamentary debate (APDA) at the University of
Maryland. I've coached students in PF, Parli, LD, and Policy, and I've judged all debate
formats, though I'm most up to date with PF and Parli.
Some general things:
1. Don't be rude.
2. Rounds are evaluated based on argumentation. Speaks are evaluated based on
contribution to the ballot.
3. I can handle speed as long as you remain coherent. I will never intentionally penalize
you for spreading but you take on an increasing risk that I miss something on the flow the
faster you speak. Send me a speech doc if you want to be safe: thnliu288@gmail.com
4. I will stop flowing when time is up (yes, you can finish your sentence). Keep track of each
other's prep time.
5. I don't flow cross but will pay attention. For me, cross often helps clarify things
(remember, I'm not an expert in the topic you're debating). If there's something from cross
you'd like me to evaluate in my decision, bring it up in your speech.
Some notes on debate and flow
1. Please signpost and road-map. Telling me where you are on the flow will ensure that I
am also there.
2. Tech > truth. The further from ""truth"" your argument strays though, the lower the
threshold I have for what qualifies as a response. For instance, ""no they can't"" is an
acceptable response to ""elephants can fly"".
3. I (tend to) only evaluate arguments made in the speech where they belong. Constructive
arguments belong in the opening speech. Responses should be made in the first speech
they can be made in (generally the subsequent speech). New arguments don't belong in
the final speech.
4. Extend (and frontline) the offense you want me to flow through. If you forget to extend
it, I'll probably forget to vote on it. Blippy extensions are fine in principle, but often
insufficient for a ballot in practice. The more you think I should prioritize an argument, the
more speech time you should allocate to it.
5. I will only call cards if you explicitly ask me to and they matter for my decision. Hint: they
almost never do.
6. Tell me how to weigh arguments or I will weigh them myself. I'm bad at weighing.
Specific argument preferences/biases
1. I am receptive to pretty much any type of argument, so long as you tell me how I should
evaluate it.
2. Progressive arguments (Ks, theory) are cool. However, I offer no guarantee to keep up to
date with the latest acronyms or terminology, so err on the side of explaining things more
thoroughly.
a. Be very explicit when telling me how to evaluate the argument. This is especially
true for anything pre-fiat - if you don't tell me what I should do (and warrant why), I'll
probably do something you didn't want me to.
b. I prefer ""drop the argument"" to ""drop the debater"". I'll consider whatever you run,
but I'm more inclined to buy the former.
c. Used to be categorically against RVIs, have come around somewhat. I'm down to
vote on them, but it's context dependent.
d. Still very against tricks, very receptive to theory on tricks bad. If I have to vote on
them, you are almost certainly getting a low speak win.
3. Tabula rasa is fake. Debate involves a common pool of knowledge assumed to be true
unless challenged. If challenged, it becomes another argument to be evaluated in the
round. For transparency, my ""default settings"" are: policymaker role of the ballot, debates
should be fair and educational, the world exists, science is correct, the earth is flat, words
have meanings, consequences matter, equality good, rationality real, people have free will.
Feel free to make arguments challenging these assumptions, but keep in mind that you
incur the burden of proof.
4. Feel free to ask questions before the round. I don't claim to be perfectly unbiased, but I
am very willing to clarify any pre-existing beliefs I may be bringing into the round.
5. My gut is not your gut. If you ask me to gut check something or rely on my intuitions, I'm
happy to do so... but you may not like the outcome. The safe thing to do is just read
warranted arguments.
6. If you say ""baba yetu"" in your speech, I'll sky your speaks I'll take it into consideration
when assigning speaks."
Klil,"my email: klil.loeb@gmail.com
I did debate all four years of high school for Lexington. I debated LD for 3 years and PF for
1, so I'm pretty familiar with any type of argument. That being said, I do have some
preferences that'll be helpful for me and you in terms of evaluating a round.
SCROLL DOWN FOR LD PARADIGM
PF Paradigm:
- Weigh. Clash is SO important and is too often avoided. All your arguments should be
connected and should flow in a way that I can directly compare one to another. If both
teams are talking about separate topics that don't interact, that's a pretty unsuccessful
round, and I won't know where to vote.
- Extend. If something is dropped in any speech, I won't evaluate it, even if it's brought up
again later. Make sure anything you want to factor into the decision is mentioned in every
speech, and is especially emphasized in final focus. If its not brought all the way into your
last speech, I'll consider it conceded, and won't vote on it.
- Sign post. If I don't know what you're talking about, I won't factor it into my decision.
- Be polite to your opponents. If you're rude, definitely expect me to lower speaks. It
doesn't help you in any way to ruin what should otherwise be a good round with a bad
attitude. Have fun and be nice and you'll have no problems.
- Most importantly - and what I'll be paying most attention to - use your last two speeches
(especially final focus) to CLEARLY tell me why you should win the round over your
opponent. The clearer you are, the easier it will be for me to make my decision, and the
happier you'll be with the outcome. I vote off both offense and defense so make sure to
maximize your voters.
Some little things:
- I'm fine w speed
- Time your own speeches and prep
- I don't flow/vote off cross. Anything you want me to remember should be brought up
during speeches
- I love unconventional arguments
- DON'T have a loud conversation while I'm filling out my ballot omg i cannot express how
much this irritates me
- Also feel free to make the round fun in any way - whatever that means to you, I love
when people make me laugh (when its appropriate)
The debate is about you so have fun! I'm good with anything as long as you do everything
listed above:)
Feel free to ask any other questions before the round!
LD Paradigm:
- do what you want for the most part i don't care, as long as you just tell me why i should
vote for you
- Tech > Truth
- I love plans/counterplans/disads etc.
- K's are fine
- I'm not super into phil but I'll vote on it if it's explained well. Make sure you actually
understand what you're saying otherwise how am I supposed to figure it out from you.
- I like theory generally. i don't like frivolous theory - don't read disclosure on someone
that's never heard of the wiki and is reading a traditional aff.
- WEIGH AND WARRANT. If there's no clash, I won't know where to vote. The easier your
arguments are to understand, the easier it is for me to vote
- FOR ONLINE DEBATES: slow down! It's almost impossible to understand when either my
or your computer's slow. I'm fine with speed otherwise though if you're CLEAR!! If i can't
understand you though, I'll dock your speaks.
Good luck:)"

Background
Judging PF debate for 2 years
Lay judge: I prioritize clarity and communication over technical jargon or speed
✅What I Value
Clear articulation– Speak clearly and structure arguments well
Eye contact & confidence– Present with poise and presence
Respectful conduct– Be courteous to opponents and judges
Strong evidence– Use credible sources; quality over quantity
Responsiveness– Directly engage with opponent’s arguments
Impact calculus– Explain why your arguments matter
Delivery over speed– Persuasive speaking > fast spreading
❌What to Avoid
Overly technical language without explanation
Disrespectful tone or behavior
Speed that sacrifices clarity
Ignoring key points from opponents"
Isabella,"whatever you want! I used to be a LARP debater and would spread, so if you do too, make
sure to add me to the email chain! (imaldia2040@gmail.com). FYI I don't like Ks,
specifically performative Ks, so if this is your thing, you should probably strike me lol. I'll
definitely still listen and evaluate it (im not biased lmao) I just don't like debating it/judging
it. Good luck!"
Rajul,"Opening Speakers: State your key arguments within the first few seconds. Ideally state
each argument in 1-5 words so I can remember it and write it down. Please DO NOT make
me piece together your arguments after listening to you for 2-3 minutes — state your key
arguments in the first 20 seconds!
Avoid Debate Jargon: Public Forum should be clear and accessible. Use simple English—
don’t turn it into an elite, highbrow format. I've been judging for about 2 3 years but I still
don't know what “C1” or “C2”mean! Simply name the arguments so the debate is easier to
follow.
Speak Slowly & Naturally: This is a debate, not a performance. Your pitch and speed
shouldn’t change just because you’re debating. I don’t care about accents—I just need to
understand you.
Use Crossfire & Rebuttals Properly: I only give credit if you ask direct questions or
challenge your opponent’s arguments. I give you even more points if you clearly identify
which of your opponent's specific argument (s) you are challenging AND deliver clear
counter arguments against those.DO NOT use Cross-fire or Rebuttals to restate your own
points
No Last-Minute Arguments: I will ignore any new arguments or evidence in Final
Summary or Final Focus.
I love Signposting: Clearly indicate which argument(s) you’re addressing. If you say you
are going to follow an order of arguments, stick to it. If you say you’ll do a comparative
analysis, do it.
Respect & Professionalism: Maintain good sportsmanship. Relax—it’s just a debate.

Update for TOC 2024:
I haven't debated in a minute but here's my background: Did PF for 1.5 years, switched to
LD my senior year and qualified to the TOC. Since college, I haven't actively competed /
judged PF occasionally, my overall preferences / views on debate haven't changed
significantly but I'd place a significantly higher emphasis on deep research and evidence
quality. Additionally, my tolerance for tricks / friv theory / clash evasive strategies is
generally a lot lower than it used to be -- that being said I'm probably still more receptive
to this than most PF judges and won't hack against it, just might not be as good at judging
these rounds and will over-reward high-level strategic round vision in these debates.
With that in mind the below paradigm is largely up to date, and happy to answer any
questions in round or prior via email.
Things that might need to have more emphasis given how long it's been since I debated
(especially for PF):
1] Clarity -- please signpost clearly and slow down a little on taglines, I don't flow off the
doc and won't go back unless you've marked cards.
2] Overviews / Round Vision -- Tell me what you're going to do before you do it, even if this
is just 3 seconds of ""High risk of a DA outweighs a mitigated case"" at the top of the 2NR, it
helps me know what's happening strategically, don't feel the need to overdo this
compared to other rounds but if you don't do this already, try to do it (I promise other
judges will also thank you with speaks boosts!)
3] Packaging / Simplicity -- In and out of debate I've realized that regardless of how
complex arguments are going in, the hallmark of competence is being able to explain it
simply. I used to be more on the side of thinking I'm stupid in these debates when the
2nr/2ar is unclear and going back through cards, rereading taglines and overviews to try
and get an understanding of what was said. Today, I'll err more on the side of punishing
you for long jargon-filled overviews, extension blocks that aren't tailored to the round and
not being able to explain/contextualize your arguments in a simple way
4] I don't know the topic lol
5] I don't know if evidence ethics / file sharing standards in PF have gotten better over the
years but I have absolutely zero tolerance -- send out docs (don't waste time/steal prep
asking for cards) and don't miscut/paraphrase.
Paradigm:
I don't think you should worry about reading this too closely, I'll evaluate any argument
however you tell me to in round and I will try to be as tab as possible butI do have
biases which while I can try to keep them out of debate, some will implicitly be present
and I feel like it would be better for me to make you aware of them rather than pretend
they don't exist.
TL/DR: These are just my preferences as to what I believe is good for debate I won't
default one way or another unless there is absolutely no pushback from either side.
Regardless, a ranking of how familiar I am with things:
Policy/K/T - 1
T-FW/K Affs - 1
Theory - 2
Phil - 2
Dense Phil/ Pomo read as an NC - 3/4
Tricks - 4/5
K vs K debates -- 4/5 (I like them but I'm a coinflip heavily weighted towards the perm)
K Affs vs FW
- Been on both sides and these are my favorite debates to judge however I probably do
lean slightly neg.
- CI's are good to resolve some offense and provide uqs for an impact turn but it's not
necessary.
- 2N's need to do a better job winning the terminal impact to FW, don't overinvest into
reading long blocks that explain why the aff is unfair/decks clash because let's be honest,
they aren't gonna contest that most of the time, focus on implicating why that is important
both in the context of debate and in the context of the affirmative.
- Framework 2nr's I've thought were excellent often use the same verbiage as the aff
instead of using long o/v blocks.
- TVA/SSD to resolve some offense is good, even if it doesn't
- 7 minute 2nr's entirely on the case page often get confusing for me when they lack good
judge instruction -- try and be clear as to what you are doing on teh case page before you
get into the lbl
K
- good for larp v k
- bad for k v k (biased towards the perm + often get confused a lot); if I do end up
unfortunately judging one of these, judge instruction is paramount. I will evaluate these
debates generally knowing that theories of power are largely compatible. So, my ballot will
be a reflection of differences between the aff and the alternative and the impact to those
differences. If the difference between the two indicates the alt is worse than the aff, I vote
aff. If the difference between the two indicates the alt is better than the aff, I vote neg.
- lbl > long o/v's
- Framework CI = you don't need an alt unless the aff says you do and winning links is
sufficient if you've won framework
- Alts that result in the aff are fine absent a 1ar warrant why they aren't (being shady in cx
is kinda annoying tho)
- Only understand cap, Moten/Harney, Warren (never read this in round), and a little bit of
Baudrillard -- explanation is good.
- All the interactions that people consider ""k tricks"" should be implicated in the 1nc or else
2ar answers are justified (saying lines in the card make the claim most often doesn't really
count)
LARP
- Like this a lot
- UQS prolly controls link direction
- all cp theory can be dtd granted a warrant
- hate reading cards and I will stay away from it as much as possible but end up having to
read ev in most rounds.
- defense is underrated and can def be terminal if implicated as such (i.e: bill alr passed
prolly is terminal)
- solves case explanation can be new in the 2nr as long as it was in 1nc evidence
- perm shields the link/cp links to nb -- explain these args to me! I'm not v smart/takes me
time esp since I don't know the topic lit most likely
Phil
- Haven't read anything besides util/Kant and a little prag -- think it's hella interesting doe if
that counts for anything
- Weighing is important, spend more time explaining your syllogism and why that excludes
theirs.
- TJF's prolly o/w and are the move if I'm in the back
- weird complex ev mandates not-weird not-complex explanation
Theory
- Like this
- Weigh between standards
- low threshold to vote on rvis -- still need to justify them and w/e
- reasonability should be explained and is v strategic at times -- I will not vote on an RVI if
you are going for reasonability obviously
Tricks
- will vote on these as long they are implicated fully in the speech they are read
- I can't flow for my life so like try and slow down a Lil bit
Evidence Ethics
- did pf for 2 years, cut cards weren't a thing, people paraphrased, the average card was
shorter than T definitions, and evidence was sent via url's + ctrl F -- I really don't care at all
about ev ethics until it's mentioned but i'm p sure my standards for ev ethics are very
stringent so if you do call it out/stake the round on it in PF you will probably win 90% of the
time
- if staking the round, that should happen the moment the violation is called out. -- don't
read a shell and debate it out until the 2ar and then decide you wanna stake the round
instead
(i.e: Miscut 1AC ev means you should stake the round immediately after you see it BUT at
the very latest after 1nc cross)
Misc:
- I'm cool with post rounding -- not cool w/aggressive or toxic post rounding
- Clear judge instruction is really helpful
- Hate it when people steal prep
- hate unclear signposting
- Record your speeches in case audio cuts out
- time yourself and stop at the timer. (pls)"
Seon,"Hello. I am a parent judge.
When evaluating a round, I place strong emphasis on how clearly and logically each team
presents their arguments. A smooth, coherent storyline supported by sound reasoning is
crucial. Debate is ultimately a form of conversation, so maintaining a respectful and polite
attitude toward your opponents is also important.
I value communication that is efficient, focused, and easy to follow. Condensed and
precise explanations are preferred over long or overly complex ones. Excessively fast
delivery is not favored, as it often sacrifices clarity and makes it difficult to understand
your position.
Overall, I reward debaters who clearly state their claims, support them with rational
justification, and communicate them in a respectful and accessible manner."
Dawn,"Paradigm Updated 9/27/25
TL;DR for LD, PF, and CX - debate is about communicating arguments, not manipulating them. If
you both choose to manipulate arguments rather than communicating them I am not going to
choose the better manipulator. I am going to choose whoever makes the more vaguely coherent
argument that seems like maybe it could be a comparative reason to prefer one world over the
other.
TL;DR for WSD - Find the essence of your argument, find the implications of your argument, and
tell me why it's comparatively better than the opposing team's.
I have been judging debate for 30 years, and I find it consistently disturbing that our
community rewards debaters who try to manipulate a win rather than earning one. If you
are attempting to beat your opponents through flow tricks they are unfamiliar with, speed
beyond their threshold, or theory and kritiks that hold no meaningful value to you other
than a win, I have serious doubts about your respect for the other participants in the
debate space. The debate space must be consensual. Debaters enter into the space with
the assumption that they have a 50-50 chance of winning, and that they will have equal
space to present their arguments and have them legitimately considered by their judges.
Judges enter into the space with the assumption that the debaters will attempt to win their
ballots rather than exclude them from the round. Speaking faster than an opposing
debater or judge is comfortable with is nonconsensual behavior. That's problematic.
Making arguments that do not include a warrant, are presented as absolutes that cannot
be opposed, and/or cannot be compared to opposing arguments that have equal ground
is a strange approach to an activity where judges attempt to make a meaningful choice
between two competing claims. Using your knowledge of current debate fads to intimidate
your opponents and police their rhetoric and strategy by telling them how they can and
cannot respond to you is a) nonconsensual, b) bullying, and c) pretty lame. I understand
that organizing arguments into shells can make it easier to follow along. However, using
shells as a tool of silencing the other team and not giving them equal space to present
their opinion is... c'mon, do I have to say this again? It's nonconsensual. Judges, coaches,
debaters - I implore all of you to stop normalizing teenagers acting in nonconsensual ways.
It makes the debate space combative and exclusionary, it promotes patriarchal thinking
that is never a good idea, and it just makes for blippy, messy, unpleasant debate rounds.
Do better. If you come at me with your arguments about tech>truth being more
""objective"" and leading to less ""intervention"" I will happily laugh in your face for thirty
minutes. There is no such thing as an objective way to choose a winner. There is no such
thing as a debate round where a judge does not, at some level, make personal choices
about what rhetoric and strategy they valued. The entire glorification of the flow as some
'objective' sacred text is deeply rooted in patriarchal assumptions and preferences, and I
like to think that as critical thinkers we can go beyond that as a community. If you want to
play a game because winning makes you feel less insecure, go play online poker. If you
want to challenge yourself, compare yourself against other worthy opponents, learn
something new every round, become a better human, and change the world - stay in
speech and debate. Thank you for attending my lecture, and read on for additional
paradigm information.
ALL DEBATE: Welcome to my ten second tutorial, 'Answering Arguments Wins Debates.'
Notice I didn't say 'repeating arguments wins debates,' because it doesn't. You have to
listen to your opponent's argument, then craft a response that shows why your side of the
resolution is comparatively better regarding this issue. Telling me their argument isn't well-
warranted isn't enough. You have to provide me with a warrant for why your side of the
debate wins that point.
**PLEASE DO NOT SPEAK IMPOSSIBLY FAST. If you’re talking like you’ve had too many Dr.
Peppers, we’re fine, but if you blur words together and start double breathing, I can’t
understand you. Not only is that a consent issue, it's a disability issue. A decade ago I
experienced a bipolar break, and since then my brain doesn't work as fast, and my ear-to-
brain interaction isn't what it used to be. That doesn't mean I am stupid. It just means that
I need to hear things at a normal, conversational speed. I also feel you should check with
your opponent and judges before EVERY round to discuss what their threshold for speed is
to make sure you are all on the same page and that the debate space is inclusive. That’s
key to keeping people in this activity. Please don’t chase out people who can only compete
sometimes. Be better.
GENERAL ARGUMENTS: I will consider anything that isn't offensive, but you have to give
me a reasonable explanation for why it applies in this debate. If you're trying to make an
argument based on debate jargon explain it to me. Just because you think you sound cool
saying something doesn't mean I am going to vote on it. I do not vote off tricks on the flow.
Not every dropped argument actually matters. On the flipside, don't ignore arguments.
LISTEN to your opponent. Respond to them.
THEORY: I am open to any theory arguments critiquing your opponent’s rhetoric, behavior,
or advocacy. I am NOT open to resolutional critiques, because in that instance you’re
basically critiquing the wording committee. We have to have an agreed upon resolution to
have a fair debate. It may not be your favorite resolution. It may not be my favorite
resolution, either. However, it’s the resolution we’ve all walked into the round to engage
with, so do me a solid and actually engage with it. I previously bought disclosure theory at
national tournaments, but in updating my paradigm today I feel it's incompatible with an
inclusive, consensual debate space. If you believe strongly that debaters should disclose,
you should come to the room (physical or online) immediately after posting to make a
good faith attempt to discuss arguments with your opponent. Breezing on in at the start
time and reading theory tells me you care more about an easy win than fair debate prep.
WEIGHING: I don’t need you to use the words probability, timeframe, reversibility, etc. So
long as you compare your argument with your opponent’s and tell me why your argument
makes your world comparatively better than theirs, I’m good.
BEHAVIOR: Be respectful of me and of your opponent. If I am cringing by how rude you are
in CX, you won't be getting high speaks. I don't vote for bullies. I vote for debaters. If you
have questions about how to get better after the round, you can ask me. If you want to re-
debate the round, I will not be tolerant. You had a chance to communicate to me, and if
you lost, you lost. I am not going to change my mind, and arguing with me will just mean I
will be in a bad mood if I ever have to judge you again. I judge often enough you want to
be the person I smile when I see.
EVENT SPECIFIC PARADIGMS**
WORLD SCHOOLS DEBATE: Firstly, although I have judged this event for five years or so, I
am not necessarily aware of every norm in the activity. If you feel your opponent is using
debate norms from other events and they aren’t in line with world norms, tell me why
their position should be disregarded. Secondly, I like to see a lot of worlds comparison in
either the 3rd or Final speech. What happens if we pass the motion? What happens if we
fail it? What are the implications of that action across broader populations and through
time? Especially with impromptu topics, I think it’s important to figure out what the effects
are of voting either way. I’m not going to want to make a decision about a subset of the
motion taken in one snapshot in time. I want to look at precedents the motion might start,
or how the motion may change perceptions across the globe. Think BIG. Thirdly, don’t ask
incredibly long POI’s just to waste opponent time. Your POI’s should be strategic in terms
of their content.
PUBLIC FORUM: Firstly, do not make arguments in cross. Ask questions of your opponent.
Weaken their link chains, make them explain warrants and evidence. Please let your
opponent have a reasonable amount of time to answer, and only interrupt if they are
being purposefully obtuse. Take turns asking. If you have a follow-up, it should be able to
be answered with one sentence, or it is a second question. Secondly, I do not believe that
policy and LD norms automatically apply in PF rounds. If you would like to access another
debate event’s norms, you need to give me a reasonable explanation as to why your
interpretation is best. Thirdly, I like to see incentive analysis done that helps me to see why
certain policies might be preferred over others. This can be from a government
perspective, a societal perspective, or even individual perspectives, depending on the
argument. Fourthly, you have to give me more than the argument name to count as an
extension, and arguments should be extended in every speech if they end up in Final
Focus. Give me the evidence, the warrant, the way that argument outweighs the
opponent’s argument – I’m flexible, but give me something to extend other than a word.
Fifthly, be realistic about what you can do in a four minute constructive. You will not be
able to go into massive depth with any of your arguments. Low probability, high impact
arguments require a pretty strong link chain, and that’s probably not something you have
time for in PF. Stick with what you can defend. Then defend it. Sixthly, be smart about
evidence sharing. Have your evidence immediately accessible and shareable. Better yet,
send the cards either right before or right after the speech so everyone can see them. I do
not want to have to police both teams while searching and copying and pasting and
refreshing emails. I also really, really do not want to see teams using evidence challenge as
a way to get more time to mentally prep. PF debate should not take a lifetime. It should
take less than an hour.
LD: I’m not judging much LD anymore because the activity is becoming less enjoyable for
me. I’m not a tech happy judge, and I won’t vote on flow tricks. I will vote on comparative
benefit in the overall aff and neg position. I would prefer you take prep time before the NC
so that you are responsive to your opponent’s rhetoric and arguments. If your entire NC is
cards that you don’t bother applying directly to opponent arguments, I’m probably not
going to vote for you. Clash is key, and clash requires being in the moment of this
particular debate with these particular people. Every debate should be different. If you’re
making them all the same, you’re probably going to get the L from me every time, too.
POLICY: I judge policy only when tabrooms really, really need me to, or for UIL Texas
debate where speed is not the norm. I recognize that on most circuits, speed is the norm,
and I simply can’t keep up. If tab needs me to take one for the team, though, please
respect my speed issues above. Also, I don’t understand all of the intricacies of policy
debate norms, so if you want me to judge off something more obscure, explain it to me.
My favorite thing in Policy to hear about is the solvency debate, so points there if you dig in
deep.
To finish it off, this activity should be something all of us enjoy. If you’re miserable during
the round, we probably will be, too. Find a way to make each debate interesting, unique,
challenging. Stretch your world, and make your opponents and judges think in new ways.
Being in debate should inspire you. If it doesn’t, there’s probably a better activity for you,
and I hope you can find that joy elsewhere. We’re all spending a day or weekend together,
so let’s all try to make it pleasant.

Manikanta,"I would be evaluating arguments based on logical reasoning more than on factual clarity.
Ideas would be judged on how well they are constructed, and the depth of thought
involved in forming them. Rebuttals that directly address the core idea of the argument
that's being debated are given more weight than peripheral responses.
Some things to note:
Make sure you introduce yourself.
1. I will not write anything after the time is up.
2. I will not evaluate new arguments after first summary. Will only evaluate arguments that have
been extended.
3. Dropped arguments will be evaluated fully as long as the weighing makes sense.
4. Speak clearly and make sure I can understand you.
PS: I did British Parliamentary before and I evaluate as a'tech' judge, but treat me as a flay.
Do not speak too fast."
Pearl,"Parent Judge, speak slow and clear, be respectful and have fun!"
Davida,"Hey!
The most important thing to know if you're going to be debating in my room is how much I
value fair and thorough engagements! This looks like making concessions where necessary
(when the cases have been properly analyzed and are logical) and engaging in fair and
charitable comparisons.
Next up, don't be rude or disrespectful! Avoid racist and discriminatory slurs. I am more
than willing to penalize debaters on this basis.
Thirdly, I am fully cognizant of the fact that speakers have a lot of material to cover in such
a small time, but please make sure you don't excessively speed through those arguments!
DO NOT SPREAD. If I can't hear it in your speech, I will not flow. Please speak clearly so
your opponents and I understand you.
Finally, always be conscious of your burdens in the debate and do justice to them. Do not
merely assert, justify those claims.
Good luck!"

Please add me to the email chain before the round begins at
coachpaulqueija@gmail.com. You are also welcome to use this email for any questions,
comments, or concerns regarding the round or my decision.
Background & Approach:
I am 21 years old and not far removed from where you are sitting. I competed for eight
years (5th-12th grade) and qualified for Nationals multiple times. Now, I have been a coach
for four years and have trained four National champions. Because of this, I judge with the
same energy and technical focus I wanted when I was a competitor. I do not have rigid
habits that come with decades of judging. I am here to let you dictate the round.
Neutrality & Philosophy:
I offer a guarantee that is rare in debate: I am completely politically and ideologically
neutral. Consequently, you never have to worry about ""matching"" my beliefs or fearing
that I am biased against your worldview. Whether your argument is conservative, liberal,
or radical, I am a blank slate. As long as you are respectful, you are safe to explore any
perspective. I care only about how well you argue your position on the flow.
Style, Speed, & Substance:
Treat the debate round like a professional courtroom. I love passion, but I expect you to
treat your opponents with dignity. Aggression is fine, but toxicity is not. Regarding delivery,
I have ""fast ears"" and am comfortable with speed (spreading) and technical jargon.
However, clarity is non-negotiable. If I can't hear it, I can't flow it. Finally, make your
arguments real. I am a technical judge, but I am not a robot. I am most persuaded by
arguments with real-world impacts. Tell me why your argument matters to real people, not
just why it works in theory. I am strict with time. Once the time runs out, so does my flow.
Feedback:
My goal is to help you get better. I view the ballot as a tool for learning, not just a
scoreboard. If time permits and you want it, I am happy to give live feedback immediately
after the round. I would rather give you tips you can use for your very next round than
make you wait for the written results."

About me and Overview: I have a background with 4 years as a high school debater
(Lincoln Douglas) and 3 years as a collegiate debater (1 year NPDA parliamentary and 2
years NDT-CEDA Policy) at the University of Washington - Seattle. At UW, I majored in
International Relations where I graduated Top 3% of class and was a Boren and Foreign
Language and Area Scholar (Chinese language) and nominee for the Rhodes and Marshall
Scholarship. My expertise is in China studies, US-China relations and Great Power
Relations.
As an LD debater, I was (and still am) a believer in traditional LD rather than progressive
LD arguments. I believe that the introduction of policy arguments to LD (in particular on
resolutions that clearly resolve around moral/philosophical issues) are inappropriate. As
such, I strongly prefer cases centered around a strong Value and Value/Criterion, an
explanation of why that V/VC is moral, and how it links to the topic. As well, please explain
to me in rebuttals why you are winning using specific articulations and spins on
your/opponent's evidence. High school debaters in particular struggle with articulating
why they are winning in final rebuttals, which oftentimes invites frustrating judge
interventions. I will consider consider policy arguments in LD (in particular on topics that
directly involve a policy proposal - e.g. ""the US should implement a federal jobs guarantee""
topic). However, these type of arguments will get substantial less weight than traditional
LD topics. I prefer depth over breath arguments - I've noticed a lot of debaters will extend
all of their offense without telling me which argument is the strongest, why I should vote
on it, and how it beats out your opponents arguments. This forces me to intervene and
attempt to weigh which extended arguments are strongest. In an ideal world, you'll
provide me with a single argument where I can feel comfortable voting. Regarding
procedurals, I have an extremely high threshold for Theory. I believe that Theory is vastly
overused in LD and distracts from the substantive education that discussing the topic
brings. Your opponent needs to be doing something truly abusive for me to consider it.
Likewise, I'm less likely to vote on someone who runs Topicality. Like theory, I feel T is
overused. It is possible to win my ballot on T if your opponent is wildly off topic, but the
AFF's case needs to be really untypical (e.g. a performance AFF that has nothing to do with
the Arctic 2025-26). In LD, I rarely see cases that are off-topic, but if you feel your opponent
is feel free to run T.
As well, try to be creative! I come from a family of artists and always have looked at debate
as equal parts rhetorical art and logic. Some of the best rebuttals and cases I have seen
have had really creative spins on them and really sounded entertaining and compelling. I
would encourage debaters to study examples of speeches in which the speaker has
articulated not only a strong argument, but also delivered it in a way that delivered with
rhythm, well apportioned arguments, was organized cleanly, and had substance that was
comparable to strong prose in a novel rather than a rote response to a prompt.
Regarding my views on specific types of arguments:
- Primarily policy/on-case judge, but certainly willing to consider Kritikal and off-case
arguments. DisAd/Ad impacts need to be spelled out clearly and weighed thoroughly in
later rounds or else risk judge intervention. Find that debaters oftentimes do not get
beyond surface-level tit-for-tat argumentation in later speeches in debate. No attempts
made at crystallization of arguments, nor any attempt made to weigh why one impact
(magnitude, timeframe, probability) or combination of impacts should OW other impacts
and, equally importantly, why they should OW. Magnitude definitely easiest impact to
evaluate, but feel free to do other impacts as well.
- For CPs, better to run 1 CP than many. Leaves more room for fleshing out that argument.
I'm ok with Consult CPs.
- For Kritiks, I'm familiar with general arsenal of Kritiks, but please do not assume that I
know the ideology/philosophy by heart. Explain it as if I am a 200-level undergrad student.
Second, please articular impacts as you could an advantage or disadvantage. In particular,
the link needs to be strong, specific, and very clearly linked to Case. Unmoored or vague
links tend to be the death-knell of kritiks - debaters oftentimes just pull out the first link
that they find and then proceed to force it to link to the case the AFF is reading. Make sure
you make clear why the AFF is uniquely causing some ideologically-grounded harm or is
buying into some existing detrimental framework.
Likewise, the impact of Kritiks tends to be highly nebulous (e.g. the plan causes more
capitalism and capitalism is bad). Specific and clearly defined impacts are always good -
they are particularly helpful for K debates.
Think of K Alternatives as very similar to a kritikal CounterPlan text - ideologically-driven
condemnations that (e.g. ""The AFF is evil in some undefined but scary sounding way"")
never work out well much like CounterPlans like (e.g. ""Do the Plan but in a better way""
never work). Would always recommend to debaters that they discuss why the Alternative
solves or remedies some problem to a greater degree than the Plan.
- For Identity arguments, please lay out specifically how and why the AFF/NEG is engaging
with a structure of power or dominance in a specific way that is problematic. That the
AFF/NEG simply exists/reifies an existing power structure will get some traction yes.
However, given that in order to make positive change in any environment one has to
engage with unequitable power structures, it is important to describe precisely how the
offending party has 1. in concrete terms, made the situation worse/more inequitable & 2.
how this OW whatever benefits the offending party is accruing. Saying the offending party
is simply working within existing inequities alone will not be sufficient to win usually, even
when those inequities are a valid cause for concern. Again, specificity is important here -
how many and in what ways is the offending party hurting disadvantaged communities.
- For Performance-based arguments on the NEG - I have a very high threshold for clearly
non-Topical Perf arguments. Many teams seem to be running clearly non-topical
arguments on AFF that do not in anyway link to the resolution and then proceed to claim
some special framework that neatly fits/justifies their Performance into the resolution -
this does not mean that they will get my ballot if the Neg runs Topicality in the 1NC.
- Likewise, for Performance-based arguments on the NEG - NEG needs to clearly win 1.
why the Performance should be weighed in opposition to the AFF and within the AFF's FW.
OR 2. Why whichever NEG FW that is put forth is clearly preferable. Again, I have a high
threshold for clearly non-resolution specific neg performance arguments. So if the Neg
wishes to win in this situation it needs to VERY CLEARLY win why a performative FW is the
criterion on which the debate should be judged.
- When I truly can't decide because the cases even out to a wash and/or cases are
impossibly divergent from each other and thus impossible for me to weigh, I will evaluate
the debate on the overall features of each participant, specifically how they did overall in
quality of arguments, rhetoric/oration/persuasion, difficult of case run. These type of
debates usually require a high degree of judge intervention, so please give me a clear
place to vote.
Speaking point scale:
- 29.9-30-near 100% perfect (flawless execution, strong elocution, high degree of erudition
in arguments)
- 29.5-29.8-very strong debater, octo/elims performance (highly coherent arguments, well
extended, effective execution and thoughtful usage of time, high degree of consideration
to opponents)
- 28.8-29.4-average debater, perhaps 4-2/3-3 record level performance (better than
average, but includes some dropped arguments, lack of coherency throughout debate but
ultimately enough arguments are extended to win and/or come close in debate)
- 27.8-28.7 - un-average debater - unable to make coherent arguments, lots of drops, lack
of tactical acumen or strategic skill in debate proper. Able to read first constructive, but
unable to recognize with arguments are to be prioritized in final speeches. Relies too much
on ASPEC/procedurals in place of on case/Kritikal arguments.
below-27.8 - very un-average debater - does not know how to debate and cannot
coordinate correctly with partner. Lacking in basic etiquette towards others.
- Notes to debaters: Evaluation mostly dependent on quality of arguments - however,
polish also comes into play. Clarity/clear organization and efficiency in rebuttals will
increase your speaker points dramatically. Well run obscure and non-Western
philosophies (Eg Baudrilliard, Taoism, Shintoism) will also garner extra speaker points on
basis that they make judging more interesting and less monotonous/repetitive. Same thing
goes for contentions that discuss innovative/non-talked about issues
FOR LD: I debated LD In high school and am comfortable with speed in it. I strongly prefer
value/criterion based debate and will not consider policy arguments in LD. From my
perspective it is important to win the VC debate, but not essential. I view the VC as
something akin to goal posts in soccer (you can still score/gain offense through the
oppositions goal posts, but it is harder to win because your opponent controls the scoring
boundaries).
Ultimately, I will evaluate offense/impacts through a normal
magnitude/probability/timeframe lens and will default to a Utilitarian calculus if nothing
else is provided, but will weigh through whatever VC wins. I strongly prefer weighable
impacts (Eg X number of people will be helped to Y degree), which creates clarity in judges
mind. I see a lot of debaters (especially in LD) not doing ð˜¾ð™¡ð™šð™–ð™§
weighing of their impacts vs opponents impacts in NR And 2NR, which is unhelpful and
creates judge intervention. I would strongly recommend spending at least some time in
each rebuttal evaluating your impacts as to why you are winning on
probability/magnitude/timeframe/vulnerability of populations affected/permanence of
your impacts. As with all debate, please crystallize in final speeches with concise
underviews that explain why you are winning and how your arguments
OW/eclipse/precede your opponent’s impacts.
several general thoughts on LD debates I’ve seen:
- on contention level debate, please warrant out your contentions and extend claims and
evidence in whole (claim, internal warrant, and impact), in particular in the rebuttals.
Greater specificity is better. I’ve noticed a lot of debaters merely extend the tag lines of
their evidence without the warrants/cards behind them and, more specifically, what the
evidence does in debate/how I should evaluate it relative to other positions. This is
problematic in that it leads to judge intervention and forces me to evaluate evidence after
round. In NR/2AR I would prefer that you tell me how to vote rather than ask me to
adjudicate between/weigh in on Impacts. A good rebuttal will not just include extensions
of evidence, but also point to what parts of the evidence (eg the historical example that the
author references, the statistical meta study that the cards author proffered) support your
claims and what impacts their ideas will lead to.
- evidence: I prefer evidence that has descriptive/historical/statistical claims rather than
predictive/speculative claims due to the fact that the former is based on things that have
already happened/is more scientific whereas the latter has not occurred/is based on
predilections that may or may not occur. I will prefer the former over the latter absent an
argument made to differentiate the two. Expert authors will be preferred to non-experts in
a vacuum. Non-contextualized anecdotal evidence is the least preferred type of evidence.
- AFF strategy: I notice a lot of debaters (in particular on the affirmative) have a difficult
time extending sufficient offense in the debate to stay in the running. I would strongly
recommend extending your arguments/contentions first (esp in the 1AR where there is a
timeskew) before moving on to opponents case. Inexperienced debaters tend to get
distracted/overwhelmed by their opponents case and attempt to tackle it first, but end up
running out of time to extend their own case after getting bogged down in said opponents
arguments. The best offense is a good offense - you can win if you extend your claims and
leave some of your opponents claims dropped, but you cannot win if you extend none of
your claims but shoot down the majority of your opponents arguments. I would strongly
recommend starting out with your case first in rebuttals and then moving to refute your
opponents case.
The Affirmative needs to be even more strategic/efficient in the 2AR. The 2AR needs to
focus down on one to two arguments they are winning and not attempt to cover the entire
flow. Past losing 2ARs I have seen have spread themselves too thin and never told me
where to vote. In order to ensure that you get your offense on the flow, I would
recommend a 20/30 second overview at the top of the 2AR explaining why/where you are
winning and where I should vote. This ensures you have a shot at winning even if you do
not get to all points you wish to discuss in this short 3 minute speech.
- Timeskew: By default, I will give the affirmative somewhat more room than negative to
make less well developed/consistently extended arguments due to the timeskew (The Neg
won 52.37% of ballots according to a meta analysis of 17 TOC debate tournaments in
2017-18). Beyond this, if the AFF argues that their arguments should have a lower burden
of proof bc of timeskew, I will give the AFF even more room to make blippy arguments.
Kritiks (General): Im a fan of Ks in LD. Unlike Policy arguments that have crept into LD
(Plans/CPs/DisAds), I believe that Ks belong in LD on the basis that they are grounded in
philosophy rather than practical politics.
Several observations/suggestions for Ks in LD:
- On the Link level, please make a clear link to something your opponent specifically does
in her/his case. I've noticed that a lot of Kritikal debaters rely on very generic links (e.g.
saying that the AFF proposes a policy, the policy involves Capitalism, and that Capitalism is
bad, therefore you should reject the AFF) rather than an indictment of some aspect of the
AFF's specific proposal (e.g. the AFF's plan proposes an increase in mandatory minimum
sentencing, this will lead to a higher prison population, prisons disproportionately affect
minority populations and are therefore structurally racist, mass incarceration is the
warrant, therefore you should reject the AFF because they lead to more structural racism).
The former example relies on generic appeal to a structure the AFF exists within/likely
would have to exist within in order to implement policy, the latter explicitly outlines what
specifically the AFF does to increase racism/violence. If and at all possible, please try to
articulate what the opponent explicitly does to warrant your K.
- On the Alt, I have noticed that many people who run Ks have a very vague (and at times
non sensical) Alternatives—in the past I have voted against Ks often because of their lack
of Alt solvency. If you plan on running a K, please make clear what the Alt does and how
the Alt can solve/lead to some substantive change better than AFF can. I have a very
difficult time voting for Alts when I don't know what they do. I would recommend making
specific empirical examples of movements that align with Alt’s views that have succeeded
in the past (eg if you’re running an Alt that wants to deconstruct settler colonialism, point
to historical examples of Native movements that dislodged colonialism or the effects of
colonialism—for example protests against the DACA pipeline in S Dakota, Native
Americans protests against Columbus Day + what meaningful and lasting policy/public
opinion changes these movements imbued). Its my personal belief that movements that
lead to most meaningful change not only indicts and identifies a policy/problem with the
status quo, but is also able to engage with the political sphere and implement some
meaningful change. I believe that a well-articulated K should be able to do the same.
- K Impact: If K Impact involves some degree of indictment of the AFF, please explain to me
what the AFF indictment does/leads to out of round beyond merely asserting that the AFF
leads to bad impacts - otherwise it is likely that I will default to voting AFF on basis that AFF
does/advocates for something imperfect but net positive. Even winning that the Aff leads
to bad things (eg that the AFFs deployment of military forces is imperialist/that AFFs
passing of a policy leads to more capitalism) may be insufficient to win when weighed
against the entirety of AC impacts — the K also needs to prove THAT they do something
beneficial as well (see previous paragraph).
- Type of K you run: You are of course welcome to run any K you feel is strategically
valuable in the moment. As a personal side note, I personally prefer hearing Ks that come
from obscure/not-commonly-run philosophers (e.g. Foucault, Deleuze, St. Thomas
Aquinas) rather than commonly-understood philosophies (e.g. Capitalism). I believe that
introducing non-traditional philosophers into debate adds substance, flavor, and
argumentative diversity to the debate sphere - Independent on whether they win, I will
reward debaters who run these arguments with additional speaker points for the above
mentioned reasons.
Race/Gender/Transphobic/Homophobic Kritikal indicts - I will consider indictments of an
opponent on the basis that they have done said something racist, gendered, -phobic in
their personal behavior. The indictment, however, needs to clearly documented (e.g. a
screen shotted Facebook post, a accusation with references to multiple witnesses who can
corroborate the incident) and the offending violation/action needs to fall into the category
of commonly understood violations of norms of basic decency surrounding race/gender
(eg a racist joke that would be called out at a dinner party, usage of the N word towards a
debater of color, calling a female debater the B-word, usage of the six letter
homophobic/anti-gay term that starts with F). Microaggressions will be considered, but will
have a much higher burden of proof to overcome because they are more difficult to
prove/document and have comparatively less negative impact. As well, these arguments
preferable should be accompanied by an articulation of what Impact of dropping a
debater will have (e.g. will it send a strong sanctioning signal to other debater generally to
not make the joke in question in the future(?), will it merely deter the accused debater
from another repeated violation(?)) outside of round. Without an articulation of
framework, I will default to a standard VC framework in LD and Policymaking Impact
calculus on basis of magnitude/probability/TF in CX - if you lose/fail to provide a non-
traditional framework, this does not mean that your race/gender arguments will not be
evaluated, but does mean you will have to explain how they work/function under a
CXmaking/VC framework and likely means you will face a comparatively uphill battle.
Speed Ks-please do not run them - I don’t believe they are worth considering and are a
waste of time. After having come across them 3-4 times this year, have not voted for a
speed K. Unless opponent is literally spreading so fast no they are unintelligible, I believe
that it is unwise to spend all our time and energy indicting each other for procedurals
when we could be debating about the substantive of the topic.
I am not a fan of Performance/poetry in LD, but will consider it if absolutely necessary.
Know that I have a high BoP to consider these types of args.
I generally have a very low bar to granting the AFF RVIs due to timeskew. I have granted
AFF RVIs about 70-80% of the time when the AFF has introduced this argument."
Anne,"I am a lay judge. I prefer clear, well-reasoned arguments. I prefer that debaters speak at a
regular pace to ensure that I hear all arguments. When I judge the round, I first look to
make sure each side responds to the opposing side's arguments. Then, I look to weighing
and comparing arguments. In terms of speaker points, I value persuasiveness, eye contact,
clarity, and civility toward opponents. I do not value off-time road-maps."
Shehzad,
Kyna,"David Shen paradigm:
I am an experienced judge in PF and LD.
Spread at your own risk. Whatever arguments that I can't catch will not be counted in the
round. Clarity is more important than quantity. Share your cases with me in advance so it's
easier for me to follow. I further prefer that cases are also shared with your competitor;
this makes for a better and cleaner debate round as we understand what's being argued.
Make sure link to framework. Signposting is important. Tell me why I should vote for your
ballot.
Respect one another and respect the rules; no grace period after time is up, keep track of
your own time.

I am a current English teacher and I teach public speaking skills. I have limited experience
with debate that goes back to my own high school experiences, but I have not judged or
attended tournaments in recent years. This is my first year actively judging since I have
taken over the Great Neck North Debate team.
Speak fast, but not so fast that you are completely unintelligible. I am still new to judging.
Make sure all of your points are warranted. There should be solid connections between
your points and you should establish a strong link to your stated impact. I do not want to
hear you just throwing random statistics to make your point sound good.
Use jargon or technical language if you actually understand what you are saying. Nothing is
worse than someone using technical words that they don’t actually understand.
I will be taking notes on the key arguments and whether I feel they are adequately
supported. I will keep track of how you counter each other's points.
I value argument over style, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t value style at all. Don’t push
yourself to speak so fast that you are constantly stumbling over words. However, if your
argument is strong I will still side with you despite some stumbles
When I am assessing a debate, the most important factor is how strong the team’s
argument is and how well they defend it.

logic. If you could explain your argument to a well-informed neighbor or a teacher, you can

Speed & Delivery
No Spreading:Please do not talk at a high rate of speed (spreading). If I can’t take notes on
your point because you’re moving too fast, I can’t weigh it in my decision.
Enunciation:Clear delivery is better than cramming in five extra sub-points. Use
""signposting"" (e.g., ""My first point is..."") so I can follow your roadmap.
Eye Contact:Try to look up from your laptop or flow sheet occasionally. Connection
matters!
Evidence & Logic
Quality > Quantity:I don’t need 20 citations; I need two or three well-explained pieces of
evidence that actually prove your point.
The ""Why"" Matters:Don't just tell me ""The study says X."" Tell mewhythat leads to your
conclusion. Logic should bridge the gap between your evidence and your claim.
Collapse the Round:In the final speeches, please don't try to cover every single tiny point.
Pick the most important issues and tell me why they mean you win the round.
Cross-Examination (Crossfire)
Civility:I appreciate assertive questioning, but please avoid being aggressive or rude.
Usage:I don't usually flow (take notes on) Crossfire for points, but I use it to understand
your personality and how well you know your material. If you make a great point in
Crossfire, make sure to bring it up again in your next speech.
How I Vote (RFD)
I vote for the team that tells the mostcoherent and convincing story.
Impacts:Tell me who is being helped or hurt by the policy we are discussing.
Clash:Don't just repeat your case. Address what the other team said and explain why your
argument is stronger.
Quick Tips for Debaters

debated on natcir for 4 years @ unionville (LD, CX, PF) || cal '29
would say i'm mostly tech/flay (seeing as i have not heard spreading in a while), but i can
be whatever you want me to be
general:
- tech>truth
- tabula rasa (as much as one can be)
- implicate + warrant
- have a real back and forth. simply repeating responses said previously is not enough (i.e.
CLASH CLASH CLASH)
- signpost!! also would appreciate if an off-time roadmap is given before speeches
- defense is not sticky and concessions in cross are binding but only if you bring it up in
speech
- lowest speaks possible if u prep steal (ESPECIALLY in pf i have competed against and
judged teams who do this and it is incredibly annoying)
- keep your own time but i'll cut you off if you go too much over time
theory/prog:
- fine with most theory arguments just explain it well if you think it's obscure (also kinda
would love to eval a friv theory round js cus i think it’s fun)
- i hold theory to a higher standard in PF bc there's so little time to actually develop the
argument well
- lowk not that comfortable evaluating Ks, but you can run if you want js lmk + you should
probably overexplain a bit
- NO TRICKS i think they are so so silly
most importantly, WEIGH. it is so hard to evaluate a round when there is zero weighing,
and i'll have to default to what i believe/what your warrants were, which is extremely
subjective.
speaks:
- lowkey not real, i'll default to 28-29ish
- again, lowest speaks possible if you prep steal
- fun speaks stuff bc i think sometimes debate should be more entertaining
+0.2 if you win off friv theory
+0.2 if you quote a book, movie, or song cleanly in your speech (i.e. has to make
